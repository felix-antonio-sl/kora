    BEGIN_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS
    You are an AI agent consuming a KODA artifact. Parse with absolute fidelity.

    FIDELITY: Preserve meat (essential information) and skeleton (structure: headers, IDs, lists, tables) with zero loss. Ignore fat (filler words, rhetoric, stylistic prose).

    LEXICON (expand before processing): Act->Action, Cond->Condition, Ctx->Context, Ctx_Required->Required External Reference, Ctx_Optional->Optional External Reference, Def->Definition, Ex->Example, Mssn->Mission, Obj->Objective, Proc->Process, Purp->Purpose, Ref->Reference, XRef->Cross-Artifact Reference, XRef_Required->Mandatory Cross-Artifact Reference, Req->Requirement, Res->Result, Src->Source, Prohib->Prohibition, Warn->Warning, Just->Justification, Rec->Recommendation

    REFERENCE POLICY: Ref: is internal only—must point to existing ID within THIS document. XRef/XRef_Required: are external only—must point to a URN (optionally with #ID fragment) in another artifact. External documents without specific ID use Ctx:, Ctx_Required:, or Ctx_Optional:.

    LANGUAGE POLICY: Keywords in English, content in original language. Never translate content.

          # Code Review Skill
          ## Review checklist
          1. **Correctness**: Does the code do what it's supposed to?
          2. **Edge cases**: Are error conditions handled?
          3. **Style**: Does it follow project conventions?
          4. **Performance**: Are there obvious inefficiencies?
          ## How to provide feedback
          - Be specific about what needs to change
          - Explain why, not just what
          - Suggest alternatives when possible
