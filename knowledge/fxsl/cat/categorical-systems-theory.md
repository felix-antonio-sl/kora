# Categorical Systems Theory

## Overview

Develops categorical systems theory, applying category-theoretic ideas to general systems theory. A system interacts with its environment through a specified interface. From environment's view, only system's interface matters. Systems interact via interfaces composable using composition patterns.

**Focus**: Modularity (build larger systems from smaller), Compositionality (facts about composite systems calculable from components).

**Provides**: A doctrine of dynamical systems, systems theory, and compositionality theorem.

## Core Concepts: Systems

### Dynamical System

State (notion of how things can be) + dynamics (notion of how things will change given how they are, potentially depending on parameters/inputs).

### Systems Theory

Answers: what is a state? How outputs vary with state? What inputs exist and depend on state? What changes are possible? How states change (deterministically, stochastically)? How changes depend on inputs?

### Cartesian Category

Category C with all finite products and terminal object. Cartesian functor F: C → D between cartesian categories preserves products and terminal objects.

## Deterministic Systems

**Definition**: Consists of State_S, Out_S, In_S, expose_S: State_S → Out_S, and update_S: State_S × In_S → State_S.

**Components**:
- State_S: set of states.
- Out_S: set of output values (exposed variables).
- In_S: set of input values (parameters).
- expose_S: State_S → Out_S.
- update_S: State_S × In_S → State_S (next state).

**Example (Clock)**: State={1..12}, Out={1..12}, In={*}, expose=id, update(t,*)=tick(t).

## Lenses

**Definition**: Pass-forward map f: A^+ → B^+ and pass-back map f^sharp: A^+ × B^- → A^-.

**Lens Composition**: (f^sharp,f): (A^-,A^+) → (B^-,B^+) and (g^sharp,g): (B^-,B^+) → (C^-,C^+) compose with pass-forward g ∘ f and pass-back defined by (a^+,c^-) |-> f^sharp(a^+, g^sharp(f(a^+), c^-)).

**Lens Category**: Objects are pairs (A^-,A^+); morfismos are lenses.

**Deterministic as Lens**: System is lens of form (update_S, expose_S): State_S <-> (In_S, Out_S).

## Wiring Diagrams

**Definition**: Lens in Arity; WD := Lens_Arity is category of wiring diagrams. Parallel products endow monoidal structure.

**Components**: Inner boxes (lenses, coalgebras, services), outer box (composite interface), wires (connections input→output).

**Universal Property**: For cartesian category C and object C in C, unique (up to isomorphism) cartesian functor ev_C: Arity → C; any wiring diagram interpreted as lens in C.

## Kleisli Category

**Definition**: Let M be commutative monad on cartesian category C. Kleisli category Kl(M) has same objects as C; morfismos f: A ~> B are maps A → M B; identity id_A = eta_A; composition f;g = f (g)^M.

**M-System**: Discrete-time system with Kleisli map update_S: State_S × In_S → M(State_S).

## Behavior Analysis

- **Trajectory**: Sequence of states generated by system dynamics.
- **Steady State**: State s such that update(s,i)=s for certain input regime.
- **Periodic Orbit**: Sequence of states repeating after finite steps.

## Monadic Effects

Monad M encapsulates computational effect:
- Maybe (partial failure)
- List (non-determinism)
- Distribution (probability)
- State S (mutable state)
- Writer W (logging/trace)
