# Categorical Cognitive Toolkit v1.2

Master map of how the Arquitecto Categórico agent uses Category Theory to think, audit, and act. Internal architecture of Arquitecto Categórico v1.2. Layer linking categorical literature to the agent's 5 cognitive engines.

## Section 1 — Ontological Core: Algebraic Database

**Schema = finitely presented category S.** Objects = entities; morphisms = relations/attributes; equations = path constraints. Use: design schemas as categories; validate associativity and identities.

**Instance = functor I: S → Set.** Assigns sets of rows and functions between them. Use: view data as realization of a structural theory.

**Migration = operators Δ/Σ/Π** induced by schema functor F: S → T. Use: model ETL as an adjunctions problem, not ad-hoc scripts.

## Section 2 — System Dynamics: Lenses and Coalgebras

**Lens = (update: S×I→S, expose: S→O).** Models systems with internal state and external view. Use: design architectures with private state and well-typed APIs.

**Coalgebra c: U → F(U).** Models observable behavior of a system given interface functor F. Use: reason about component equivalence via bisimulation.

**Bisimulation.** Relation identifying states with same behavior under all inputs. Use: safe refactoring and substitution of microservices.

## Section 3 — Completeness and Effects (Monads)

**Monad catalog** (Maybe, List, Distribution, State, Writer): encapsulates computational effect types. Use: explicitly choose the effect type when modeling real processes.

**Kleisli category Kl(M).** Morphisms A→M(B) for composing effects. Use: compose pipelines with failures, non-determinism, or probabilities in a structured way.

## Section 4 — Meta-Modeling and DIK Hierarchy

| Level | Categorical Model |
|-------|-----------------|
| Data | Instance I: S → Set (concrete facts) |
| Information | Schema S (structure and rules) |
| Knowledge | Category of schemas/models (Cat or Mod) and their transformations |

Operation: elevate or lower level (Data→Info→Knowledge) according to the nature of the problem.

## Section 5 — Multi-Model Integration and Data Lakes

**Schema Category** (global): objects = types (tables, collections, nodes); morphisms = relations (FKs, refs, edges, paths). Use: unified view before integration.

**Grothendieck construction ∫F.** Flattens indexed families of schemas into a global space. Use: model multi-tenant Data Lakes and federations.

## Section 6 — Model Categories and Complexity

**Category of models.** Objects = sets of assumptions; morphisms = refinement relations.

**Partial order by assumption inclusion.** Enables discussion of minimal/maximal models.

**Convertible models.** Same assumptions, different formulations connected by natural transformation.

## Section 7 — Action as Primary Key

**In episodic domains** (logs, workflows): the action (morphism) is the primary key; state is inferred. Use: design event-oriented systems and event sourcing.

**Stream of actions as final coalgebra.** Behavior takes precedence over internal state.

## Section 8 — MBSE Consistency and Multi-Model Systems

**Catmodel.** Category representing a system model (blocks, ports, connections). Use: formalize SysML/UML models as categorical objects.

**Consistency between models** = existence of common submodel (pullback in category of models). Use: verify compatibility between MBSE and Safety models.

**Partial order by injection.** Compares structural complexity of models. Use: organize model variants of a system in a lattice.

## Section 9 — Agent Operative Directives

| Directive | Principle |
|-----------|----------|
| CTK-IMP-FORMALIZE | Formalize before implementing: always define category and diagrams before code |
| CTK-IMP-UNIVERSAL | Seek universal properties (products, coproducts, limits, colimits, adjunctions) |
| CTK-IMP-STRUCTURE | Preserve structure via functors instead of ad-hoc scripts |
| CTK-IMP-COMPOSE | Compose, do not couple: build systems by composing morphisms and lenses |
| CTK-IMP-INVARIANTS | Think in invariants: use bisimulation and commutative diagrams as truth criteria |

## Section 10 — The 5 Categorical Engines

| Engine | Foundation |
|--------|-----------|
| CM-MIGRATION-ENGINE | Δ/Σ/Π and Kan lifts for all data migrations |
| CM-BEHAVIOR-ENGINE | Lenses, coalgebras, and monads for system dynamics |
| CM-STRUCTURE-ENGINE | Limits, colimits, and diagram verification (static) |
| CM-INTEGRATION-ENGINE | Multi-model synthesis and Grothendieck |
| CM-AUDIT-ENGINE | Categorical diagnosis of DIK artifacts, migrations, behavior, global KB |

## Section 11 — Categorical Audit Engine

**Four internal audit modes:**
- STATIC: isolated artifact.
- TEMPORAL: migrations and versions.
- BEHAVIORAL: coalgebras and bisimulation.
- KB-GLOBAL: complete knowledge graph.

**Audit dimensions.** Structural, referential, completeness, categorical quality, migrations, behavior, KB global. Covers: identities/composition, references (Ref/XRef), operational Procs, limit/colimit usage, migration correctness, bisimulation when applicable.

**Severity levels:**
- CRITICAL: invalid structure.
- HIGH: compromised integrity.
- MEDIUM: incomplete/suboptimal.
- LOW: improvement opportunity.

**Standard DIK Audit Report.** Classification + summary by dimension + issue list + improvement proposals based on patterns. Deliverable: repeatable and traceable audit results.
