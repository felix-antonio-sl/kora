# Algebraic Model Management

Schultz et al. (2017). Model Management not as ad-hoc scripts but as rigorous mathematical discipline. Models as objects in a category; management operations (merge, diff, match) as categorical constructions (pushouts, pullbacks).

## Core Definitions

**AMM (Algebraic Model Management).** Treats models and relations as complex algebraic structures to automate software engineering tasks: evolution, synchronization, transformation.

**Megamodel.** Model whose elements are other models and whose relations are semantic links (instantiation, transformation, trace).

**Data (model).** Individual model formalized as a graph G or algebraic term; object in category Graph or an algebraic specification.

**Typed model (information).** Not merely graph G but a typing morphism t: G → TG where TG = type graph (metamodel). Objects in slice category Graph_TG.

**Merge.** Colimit (pushout) of two models over a common interface.

**Pullback.** Categorical tool for aligning/making consistent structures in comparisons and correspondences.

**Model Management operators.** Match, Merge, Diff, Split, Compose.

**Coupled Transformations.** Functors that migrate models in response to metamodel changes (co-evolution).

## DIK Hierarchy — Algebraic Model Management

**Data = individual model.**
- Definition: graph G (individual model) or algebraic term.
- Formalism: object G in Graph or an algebraic specification.
- Interpretation: pure syntax of the artifact (e.g., node/edge structure of a UML class diagram before UML metamodel conformance).

**Information = typed model.**
- Definition: typing morphism t: G → TG, TG = type graph (metamodel).
- Formalism: objects in slice category Graph_TG.
- Interpretation: t assigns semantic meaning to data nodes — "this node is a Class", "this edge is Inheritance". Information = structure (G) validated by semantics (TG).

**Knowledge = megamodel.**
- Definition: model whose elements are other models; relations = semantic links (instantiation, transformation, trace).
- Formalism: graph where nodes = models (information objects) and edges = conformity or transformation relations.
- Interpretation: map of the territory. Enables reasoning about the complete system: "If I change Metamodel A, I must migrate Model B using Transformation T". Captures design intent and traceability.

**Modeling = execution of algebraic operators.**
- Operators: Match, Merge, Diff, Split, Compose.
- Merge = colimit (pushout) of two models over common interface.
- Diff = algebraic complement or inverse construction.
- Coupled Transformations = functors migrating models in response to metamodel changes (co-evolution).
- Interpretation: "calculation". Instead of manual editing, the architect applies operators: Model_Final = Merge(Model_A, Model_B). Functional manipulation of architecture.

## Summary

| Level | Formalism | Construction |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Data | G ∈ Graph | raw graph / algebraic term |
| Information | t: G → TG | slice category Graph_TG |
| Knowledge | Megamodel (M_i, relations) | nodes = models, edges = links |
| Modeling | Operators (Merge, Diff, ...) | pushouts, coupled transformations |

Theoretical basis for tools such as Catlab.jl; efficient management of complex systems requires mathematical rigor.
