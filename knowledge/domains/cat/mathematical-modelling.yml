Abstract:
  ID: MM-ABS-01
  Def: "Solution of any engineering problem starts with a modelling process, which provides a model representing a system under consideration. This document proposes a category theory-based modelling framework for mathematical models, introducing categories of mathematical models, notions of complexity and convertibility, and constructions for coupled models. Various examples illustrate how category theory can clarify relations between models and detect conceptual modelling errors."

        - "Basic assumption library: formalize standard assumptions/operators (Fourier’s law, Gauss theorem, etc.) with types."
        - "Declare types: for variables, material coefficients, etc."
        - "Type check: compose assumptions via higher-level notation; if well-typed, the model is consistent."
