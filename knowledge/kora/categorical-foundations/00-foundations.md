# Categorical Foundations for KORA

## Purpose

This document establishes the mathematical prerequisites for the KORA formal layer. Every construct used in documents 01-05 of this series is defined here. This is the **only** document in the formal layer that introduces notation — all other documents reference this one.

## Notation Convention

Throughout this formal layer:
- Objects are denoted by capital letters: A, B, C
- Morphisms by lowercase: f, g, h
- Functors by capital: F, G, T
- Natural transformations by Greek: α, β, η, ε
- Categories by bold or calligraphic: **C**, **D**, Set
- Monads by M
- Composition by ∘ (right-to-left) or ; (left-to-right, diagrammatic)

## 1. Category

**Definition.** A category **C** consists of:
- A collection Ob(**C**) of objects
- For each pair A, B ∈ Ob(**C**), a set Hom(A, B) of morphisms
- For each A, an identity morphism id_A: A → A
- A composition operation ∘: Hom(B, C) × Hom(A, B) → Hom(A, C)

satisfying:
- Associativity: h ∘ (g ∘ f) = (h ∘ g) ∘ f
- Identity: f ∘ id_A = f = id_B ∘ f

**Key instances in KORA:**
- Set: objects = sets, morphisms = functions
- Cat: objects = small categories, morphisms = functors
- Pos: objects = elements of a poset, morphisms = order relations

## 2. Functor

**Definition.** A functor F: **C** → **D** assigns:
- To each object A ∈ **C**, an object F(A) ∈ **D**
- To each morphism f: A → B in **C**, a morphism F(f): F(A) → F(B) in **D**

preserving:
- Identity: F(id_A) = id_{F(A)}
- Composition: F(g ∘ f) = F(g) ∘ F(f)

**Endofunctor.** A functor F: **C** → **C** (same source and target category).

**Contravariant functor.** F: **C**^op → **D**. Reverses morphism direction: if f: A → B then F(f): F(B) → F(A).

## 3. Natural Transformation

**Definition.** Given functors F, G: **C** → **D**, a natural transformation α: F ⇒ G assigns to each object A ∈ **C** a morphism α_A: F(A) → G(A) in **D** such that for every f: A → B:

```
        F(f)
  F(A) -----→ F(B)
   |            |
   | α_A        | α_B
   ↓            ↓
  G(A) -----→ G(B)
        G(f)
```

commutes: α_B ∘ F(f) = G(f) ∘ α_A.

**Natural isomorphism.** α where every α_A is an isomorphism.

## 4. Adjunction

**Definition.** An adjunction L ⊣ R between categories **C** and **D** consists of:
- Functors L: **C** → **D** (left adjoint) and R: **D** → **C** (right adjoint)
- Unit η: Id_**C** ⇒ R ∘ L (natural transformation)
- Counit ε: L ∘ R ⇒ Id_**D** (natural transformation)

satisfying the triangle identities:
- (ε_L) ∘ (L η) = id_L
- (R ε) ∘ (η_R) = id_R

**Equivalent characterization.** Bijection natural in A, B:
Hom_**D**(L(A), B) ≅ Hom_**C**(A, R(B))

**Properties of interest:**
- η iso ⟹ L is full and faithful (R reflects **C** inside **D**)
- ε iso ⟹ R is full and faithful (L reflects **D** inside **C**)
- η iso and ε iso ⟹ equivalence of categories

## 5. Monad

**Definition.** A monad on **C** is a triple (M, η, μ) where:
- M: **C** → **C** is an endofunctor
- η: Id ⇒ M is the unit (embeds pure values)
- μ: M ∘ M ⇒ M is the multiplication (flattens nested effects)

satisfying:
- μ ∘ M(μ) = μ ∘ μ_M (associativity)
- μ ∘ η_M = id = μ ∘ M(η) (unit laws)

**Kleisli category.** Kl(M) has:
- Same objects as **C**
- Morphisms A → B in Kl(M) are morphisms A → M(B) in **C**
- Composition: g ∘_Kl f = μ_C ∘ M(g) ∘ f (Kleisli composition, denoted >=>)

**Key monads in KORA:**

| Monad | M(A) | Effect | Agent meaning |
|-------|------|--------|---------------|
| Identity | A | None | Pure transitions, no sandbox |
| Writer W | A × W | Logging | Audit trail on every transition |
| Powerset P | P(A) | Nondeterminism | Multiple valid next states |
| Distribution D | Dist(A) | Probability | Stochastic sampling |

## 6. Coalgebra

**Definition.** Given an endofunctor F: **C** → **C**, an F-coalgebra is a pair (U, c) where:
- U ∈ Ob(**C**) is the carrier (state space)
- c: U → F(U) is the structure map (transition morphism)

**F-coalgebra morphism.** Given (U, c) and (V, d), a morphism h: U → V such that F(h) ∘ c = d ∘ h:

```
       c
  U ------→ F(U)
  |           |
  | h         | F(h)
  ↓           ↓
  V ------→ F(V)
       d
```

**Bisimulation.** A relation R ⊆ U × V such that related states produce related outputs. Formally: there exists a coalgebra structure on R making both projections coalgebra morphisms.

**Final coalgebra.** Terminal object in the category of F-coalgebras. Unique morphism from any coalgebra (the unfold/anamorphism). Two states are bisimilar iff they map to the same element of the final coalgebra.

**Coinduction principle.** To prove a property P holds for all behaviors of a coalgebra, show that P is a bisimulation.

## 7. Lens

**Definition.** A lens between state spaces S and T is a pair:
- get: S → T (expose the view)
- put: S × T → S (update the state)

satisfying:
- GetPut: put(s, get(s)) = s
- PutGet: get(put(s, t)) = t
- PutPut: put(put(s, t₁), t₂) = put(s, t₂)

**In Kl(M).** A monadic lens replaces put with put: S × T → M(S), where updates produce effectful states.

**Composition.** Lenses compose:
- get_{l₂ ∘ l₁} = get_{l₂} ∘ get_{l₁}
- put_{l₂ ∘ l₁}(s, c) = put_{l₁}(s, put_{l₂}(get_{l₁}(s), c))

## 8. Fiber Product and Coproduct

**Product.** A × B with projections π₁: A×B → A, π₂: A×B → B satisfying the universal property: for any C with f: C → A and g: C → B, exists unique h: C → A×B.

**Coproduct.** A + B with injections ι₁: A → A+B, ι₂: B → A+B satisfying the dual universal property.

**Fibered coproduct (pushout).** Given f: C → A and g: C → B, the pushout A +_C B identifies elements with common preimage in C. Universal property: for any D with compatible morphisms from A and B, exists unique morphism from A +_C B to D.

## 9. Presheaf

**Definition.** A presheaf on **C** is a functor P: **C**^op → Set.

**Yoneda embedding.** y: **C** → [**C**^op, Set] defined by y(A) = Hom(−, A). Fully faithful (Yoneda lemma): Nat(y(A), P) ≅ P(A).

**Interpretation.** A presheaf assigns to each object a "set of things visible from that object" and to each morphism a "restriction map." Contravariance means: a morphism f: A → B induces P(f): P(B) → P(A) — moving "toward" B restricts what's visible.

## 10. 2-Category

**Definition.** A 2-category **K** consists of:
- 0-cells (objects): A, B, C, ...
- 1-cells (morphisms between objects): f, g: A → B
- 2-cells (morphisms between morphisms): α: f ⇒ g

with two composition operations:
- Horizontal composition of 1-cells: g ∘ f (as in a category)
- Vertical composition of 2-cells: β • α (composing transformations)
- Horizontal composition of 2-cells: β ∗ α (whiskering)

satisfying the **interchange law**: (β' • α') ∗ (β • α) = (β' ∗ β) • (α' ∗ α).

**Examples:**
- **Cat**: 0-cells = categories, 1-cells = functors, 2-cells = natural transformations
- **Pos**: 0-cells = posets, 1-cells = monotone maps, 2-cells = pointwise ≤

## 11. Free Construction

**Definition.** Given a forgetful functor U: **D** → **C**, a left adjoint F: **C** → **D** (when it exists) is called the **free construction**. F ⊣ U.

The free construction F(A) is the "simplest" object in **D** generated by A ∈ **C** — it has exactly the structure needed to be an object of **D** and nothing more.

**Properties:**
- Unit η: A → U(F(A)) embeds generators into the free object (always injective for algebraic theories)
- Counit ε: F(U(D)) → D maps the free object generated by the underlying set of D back to D (surjective — forgets the extra "free" structure)
- η iso means the embedding is lossless (U reflects **C** faithfully into **D**)
- ε surjective means the free construction is a quotient of D (some structure in D is not "free")

## 12. Wiring Diagram

**Definition (Spivak).** A wiring diagram is a morphism in the category WD of typed interfaces. An interface is a pair (In, Out) of types. A wiring diagram φ: (In₁, Out₁) × ... × (In_n, Out_n) → (In, Out) specifies how the outputs of inner boxes connect to inputs of other inner boxes or the outer interface.

**Composition.** Wiring diagrams compose by substitution: plugging a wired system into a slot of another wiring diagram.

**Monoidal structure.** Parallel composition ⊗ places systems side by side without interaction.
