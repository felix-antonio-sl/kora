# Principle-based Organizational Structure

Handbook for engineering entrepreneurial thinking and teamwork into organizations of any size. Audience: leaders, executives, managers responsible for organizational design. Nature: engineering science applied to organizational structure.

Mission: enable leaders to design high-performance organizational structures based on scientific principles. Foundation: organizational structure is engineering science with firm principles and constructs.

## Core Thesis

Organizational Machine: organization as machine that either achieves vision or frustrates ambitions. Src: Sergio Paiz — "Most managers focus on operating poorly designed machine, struggle with it, rather than stepping back and redesigning machine." Google case: Bill Coughran (SVP Engineering 2003–2011) knew GFS would have to be replaced within couple of years; goal = build organization capable of innovating continually. Foundation: role of leader of innovation is not to set vision and motivate others, but to create community willing and able to generate new ideas.

Three Strategic Vectors — great leaders pursue all three in parallel:

| Vector | Definition |
|--------|-----------|
| Market | Alignment with customers |
| Technical | Product/service capabilities |
| Organizational | The machine itself (this document's focus) |

Key elements of organizational design: structure, culture, resource-governance processes, methods, metrics. Structure is most powerful of all elements. Structure def.: organization chart defining everybody's domains, and processes combining those specialists on teams.

## Benefits and Symptoms

| Healthy Structure | Symptoms of Poor Structure |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Individual accountabilities clear; people deliver results | Unclear accountabilities; task/process-focused rather than results-focused; territorial disputes |
| Staff focused on single profession; perform better | Poor performance; jobs too big for most people |
| Customer-focused; relationships with clients improve | Lack of customer focus; initiatives product- or technology-driven |
| Teams form spontaneously; cross-boundary teamwork effective | Difficulties with cross-boundary teamwork; organization of independent silos |
| Reliable, quick delivery at lower risk | Slow or unreliable delivery |
| Costs competitive; redundancies eliminated | High costs; empire building |
| Product quality increases; product line integrated | Poor quality; poorly integrated product line |
| Staff creative and entrepreneurial; pace of innovation improves | Lack of entrepreneurial spirit; lagging in innovation |
| Great place to work; empowered; conflicts of interests eliminated | Low morale; disempowerment; dead-end jobs; cynicism; stress |
| Structure lasting; not designed around incumbents; evolves automatically | Repeated restructurings, each fixing some problems and creating others |

Unhealthy structure: not "supplier of choice" to customers nor "employer of choice" to staff. Stressful to lead; little time for strategic thinking.

## Science of Structure

Foundation: organizational structure is engineering science, not matter of personalities, politics, personal style. Def. science (American Heritage Dictionary): observation, identification, description, experimental investigation, theoretical explanation of phenomena. Nature: applied science with firm principles and constructs. Principles emerged from real-world empirical observations, generalized, tested over decades. Result: principles now so clear one can look at any org chart and know who's fighting with whom, who's not making objectives.

Without studying science, reorganizations guided by: incumbents' personalities and careers, overly simplistic models (like "build versus run"), industry fads (like matrix), client pressures, today's work/priorities, intuition. Result: structure evolves through incremental changes by different executives; resembles patchwork quilt.

Reasons to study: (1) Avoid Organization du Jour — without guiding principles, each restructuring solves some problems while creating others; principle-based structure dynamically adapts and lasts without repeated reorganizations; (2) Easier to Explain — participation from leadership team takes advantage of people's knowledge and builds commitment; (3) Don't Blame People — leaders have moral obligation to know difference between poorly performing person and good person in poorly designed job (Sondra University case: succeeded at sales, failed at coordinating enterprisewide initiatives — two very different jobs given to one person); (4) New Levels of Performance — Src: Preston Simons, CIO at Aurora Health Care, former CIO at Abbott Laboratories: consistently leads to improved role clarity, better teamwork, customer focus, entrepreneurship, improved performance.

## Why People Alone or Processes Alone Are Not Enough

People: superior people can overcome structural dysfunctions but inordinate amount of time/energy spent resolving confusion and friction. Large airline case: three successive systems-engineering managers fired for failure to innovate; all bright/experienced; structure set them up to fail — operations director paid for stability, innovation disrupts stability. Conclusion: great people in bad structure will fail; if structure causing people to do wrong things, "better" people will just do wrong things faster. Normal bell-curve of people in healthy structure can succeed. Great organizations are, by design, those where average people can succeed and super-achievers can super-succeed.

Processes: (1) if nobody specializes in given discipline, processes depending on that competency will fail; (2) structure can override processes — when caught between conflicting forces, staff optimize performance appraisals; (3) predefined processes only work for highly structured/routine work; in functions requiring flexibility and innovation, they make organization more rigid and less creative. Conclusion: great people working with great processes can't perform well unless structure they live in is well designed.

Structure: foundation on which good people and processes thrive. Most powerful driver of organization's performance: efficiency, effectiveness, agility, quality, creativity, innovation, competitiveness, customer satisfaction. Key element of staff's competence, job satisfaction, motivation, commitment, happiness, loyalty.

## Seven Fundamental Principles

| # | Principle | Statement |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Golden Rule | Authority and accountability must match |
| 2 | Specialization and Teamwork | You can only be world-class at one thing at a time; but you can't specialize if you can't team |
| 3 | Precise Domains | Define clear boundaries with no overlaps or gaps |
| 4 | Basis for Substructure | Divide function into groups based on what it's supposed to be good at |
| 5 | Avoid Conflicts of Interests | Don't expect people to go in two opposing directions |
| 6 | Cluster by Professional Synergies | Cluster groups under common boss based on similar professions |
| 7 | Business Within a Business | Every manager is entrepreneur whose job is to satisfy customers with products and services |

## Principle 1: Golden Rule — Authority = Accountability

Most important principle; absolutely essential. Consequences of violation:

| Imbalance | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Authority without accountability | Person becomes unconstrained tyrant; makes decisions without bearing consequences; others take blame |
| Accountability without authority | Person disempowered; cannot be held accountable for results if lacks resources/authorities needed; adopts helpless "victim" mentality |

Case studies: (1) Process owners with authority over processes but without accountability for service effectiveness → process owners succeeded at rigidifying processes; service-delivery groups took blame when they failed → organization became bureaucratic, slow, inflexible. (2) CFO cuts others' budgets without accountability for business results → rewarded for cost savings, not blamed for poor performance caused. (3) Customer-service manager held accountable for resolving problems without resources or authorities to solve them → resolution impeded; satisfaction suffered.

Healthy model: everybody is "process owner" for own products/services; everybody accountable for frugality; everybody accountable for resolving any problems they create.

Empowerment: everybody accountable for own results, has authority over information, resources, decisions needed. Not anarchy; not blank check. Fixed-sum equation: if anyone has more authorities than accountabilities, somebody else has less. Empowerment fundamental to motivation; hard to feel good if treated as child and told what to do. Applies at every level — if subordinates inexperienced, empower in smaller chunks. Even junior people can be empowered with authorities matching accountabilities.

Mandating "How" instead of "What": hold people accountable for results; leave them free to decide how to attain those results. SOx Compliance Waste case: Wallace claimed ~1/3 of major ERP implementation costs wasted in name of SOx compliance — 50% increase in project costs — because IT required to produce documentation in specific format (UML) that didn't fit neatly with vendor documentation. Distinction: defining every aspect of "what" (artifacts, status reports) is NOT disempowering; requiring specific "how" IS.

Leader's role in empowered organization: (1) decide rules of game (create organizational ecosystem: structure, resource-governance processes, culture); (2) adjust domains, arbitrate boundary disputes, ensure teamwork; (3) develop talent within group (coaching = advice staff may or may not follow; if forced, leader must share accountability for results); (4) manage performance (objectives, feedback, results, rewards, performance problems); (5) manage commitments and resources; (6) coordinate shared decisions on methods and tools; (7) make decisions where consensus cannot be reached; (8) guide business and product strategies within group; (9) serve as diplomat. Summary: create right environment, do everything possible to help subordinates succeed. Managing by results gives more, not less, control; leader becomes driver of machine, not cog.

Implications for structure: define jobs based on what people produce, not how they do work. Job descriptions: "accountable for delivering," not "responsible for doing." Never create job whose purpose is to disempower others. Don't create steering committees or process owners who constrain others' prerogatives.

## Principle 2: Specialization and Teamwork

Customer-centric structure case study: CIO dedicated group to each client business unit (Janice: Sales/Marketing; Bill: Finance; Henry: HR/Corporate; Eugene: Engineering/Manufacturing). Initial success: clients felt IT more responsive, better understood business. Problems: engineering sub-optimized — each technology sub-specialty scattered; limited professional exchange; little impetus for standards; reduced ability to specialize; costs rose, quality suffered, response times slowed; pace of innovation slowed; missed opportunities (no specialists in web/mobile); multiple general-ledger systems and multiple records for same customer. Conclusion: customer-aligned organization performed no better than decentralized groups; didn't deserve to stay together.

Why organizations exist — Cybernetic Variety: humans have finite "brain cycles" each day. Variety = COMPLEXITY × PACE (measure of throughput; amount and diversity of information confronting organization at any point in time). World around us swarms with immense variety, too much for any one person to grasp.

| Choice | Description | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Generalist | Know a little about everything | Able to do many things, none particularly well |
| Extreme Specialist | Focus all on one topic | Excel at that one thing; can't work well with others |
| T-shaped Specialist | Focus on one profession, still know a little about lots | Practical specialist; definition of what works |

Conclusion: people can only be world-class experts at one thing at a time. Src: Niels Bohr — "An expert is person who has made all mistakes that can be made in very narrow field." Organizations exist to allow people to specialize. When T-shaped specialists in diverse fields work together, organization has both depth and breadth. Organization of generalists performs no better than equal number of individuals.

Benefits of specialization (Adam Smith described advantages of "division of labor" in 1776):

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Productivity | Specialists more efficient; cost savings |
| Speed | Ready answers; no learning curve |
| Quality | Higher quality; more usable, capable, maintainable |
| Risk | More reliable results, fewer risks |
| Innovation | Specialists keep up with literature; first to learn of emerging technologies |
| Reduced Stress | Less stress; confident of abilities |
| Motivation | Greater competence → easier to excel → better career opportunities |

Specialization concerns: (1) organizations can't be "one deep" (dependent on single individual); cross-training or broader domain definitions address this; (2) healthy specialization is not job narrowing — specialists do everything in their field (customers, today's work, past support, innovations, planning, process improvement); (3) market rewards specialists; some resist specialization to avoid accountability.

Specialization requires teamwork: organization of specialists acting independently would perform terribly — no one sees big picture. More people specialize, more they become interdependent. If organization not good at cross-boundary teamwork, must back away from specialization so groups become self-sufficient generalists (silo organization). Silo def.: groups self-sufficient, don't need to work together; each profession scattered; fragmentation reduces specialization; performance falls. Antidote to silos: effective teamwork across boundaries — managers manage team-members in other groups as they do external vendors.

Implications: don't design jobs for generalists; jobs should be designed around well-focused specialties; invest in cross-boundary teamwork mechanisms to enable greater specialization.

## Principle 3: Precise Domains

Organization chart determines everybody's domains (boundaries within which each group functions). Vague domains case: Rick (Infrastructure) and Charlie (Enterprise Architecture) both believed they had authority over design of infrastructure → fought because structure paid them to fight.

Overlaps: when domains unclear, multiple groups think they're responsible for same function. Costs: reduced specialization, redundant efforts, less innovation, confusion (customers don't know where to go), product dis-integration, less teamwork, lack of entrepreneurship. Intentional internal competition: creates same problems and should never be needed — outside vendors and benchmarking studies serve as competitive checks.

Gaps: when function missing, gaps occur. Results: unreliable delivery, reduced specialization, overlaps (groups that need missing specialty fill it for themselves → multiple groups fill same gap). IT gaps case: Jim, Donna, Carey each developed expertise in sub-technologies outside core domain; multiple learning curves; no one ensuring comprehensive range of supporting technologies available.

RACI Framework problems: "Responsibilities" defines tasks not results; "Accountable" may separate authority from accountability; "Consulted" fixed list lacks accountability for results; "Informed" fixed list may not be right stakeholders. Downside of jobs designed around tasks: people execute tasks, not accountable for results; each group sub-optimizes its steps; boss who coordinates tasks has no time for own challenges; when disempowered staff interact with customers, both frustrated.

Domains based on results: key to good domains = bounding what people produce rather than what they do. Applications manager case: Aaron (accountable for entire portfolio of applications), Mark (produces requirements definitions — not product designs), Jay (sells project planning and facilitation services). Since each group only produces results within its domain, boundaries clear.

Implications: provide every group with precisely worded boundaries; ensure no overlaps (never create internal competition); ensure no gaps; domains should bound what people produce; each box on org chart should be accompanied by carefully worded paragraph clearly bounding what each group produces.

## Principle 4: Basis for Substructure

When organization big enough to require multiple groups in essentially same profession, how to divide deliverables among groups? Basis for substructure: the way you divide domains among groups within a profession; determines people's specialties (their bottom-of-the-T).

Structure by clients' business processes case study: CIO dedicated groups to product-development process (Gail), order-to-invoice process (Jerry), financial/administrative processes (Tom). Problems:

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Redundant learning curves | All groups required many common skills; parallel learning curves increased costs and delayed projects |
| Redundant work | Both Gail and Jerry developed document-tracking modules |
| Reduced specialization | Groups became experts on clients' business processes, generalists in engineering discipline |
| Product dis-integration | Each group developed own versions of financial/customer/product databases; conflicting reports |
| Weak client relationships | Multiple points of contact per client; clients had to determine which workflow to discuss before knowing whom to call |
| Biased business diagnosis | Group dedicated to business process naturally biased in favor of automating that workflow |

| Basis | Specialization | Generalism |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Clients' business processes | Workflows | Clients, engineering disciplines, services |
| Clients (business units/territories) | Close to those clients | Organization's products and services |
| Technologies and disciplines | Those products | Clients |
| Services | Delivery of those services | Clients and products |

Consequences of wrong basis: reduced specialization, domain overlaps, inappropriate biases (wrong basis induces wrong biases; staff give poor advice, optimize wrong objectives), disempowerment (two groups fulfilling same function: one thinking, one delivering; neither wholly responsible). Implications: use basis for substructure that exactly matches what people are supposed to be good at. If want engineers good at designing things, define domains by what they design; if job of Sales is to know clients, define domains by clients they serve.

## Principle 5: Avoid Conflicts of Interests

If wrong deliverables put together in single job, conflicts of interests arise. Martha's Governance Group case: business relationship management (clients' side) + demand management (deciding priorities) + PMO — every combination creates conflict.

Five Fundamental Conflicts of Interests:

| Conflict | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| 1. Invention vs. Operations | Operational issues take precedence; fire-fighting swamps invention | George: manager given infrastructure operations + engineering; operations stabilized but innovation stopped. Telecom cable manufacturer: executive given business development + operating acquired companies; after first acquisition, no time for new deals |
| 2. Purpose-specific Solutions vs. Components | Group expected to produce both builds in unhealthy bias toward familiar platforms | IT: business applications (purpose-specific) vs. component technologies (computing platforms, databases, middleware). PDC Bleach: distinguishing base chemical from consumer bleach opened new revenues |
| 3. Enterprisewide Thinking vs. Focus of Specialist | Decision assigned to any one impacted domain will be biased in favor of that stakeholder | IT technology standards: if decided by network engineers, may neglect interests of other engineers |
| 4. Technical Specialization vs. Unbiased Diagnosis | Specialization brings quality but also bias | "Give child hammer, and everything looks like nail!" |
| 5. Service Orientation vs. Audit | Impossible to build relationship with customers while also judging them | "I'm from Internal Revenue Service; I'm here to help!" |

Consequences: gaps in performance (mediocre at both missions), unpredictable balance (not deliberate; people decide based on predilections), stress (don't know what to do; health problems). Implications: reserve conflicts of interests for highest possible level in org chart, ideally top executive alone; healthy structure defines jobs focusing on only one side of each paradoxical dimension; allows executive to explicitly adjust balance by shifting resources between groups.

## Principle 6: Cluster by Professional Synergies

Cluster groups under common boss based on similar professions, not who works with whom. Process-centric groups case: CIO dedicated groups to IT processes (Ruth: applications development, Bob: infrastructure engineering, Matt: incident management, Art: operational service delivery). Problems: all became less specialized as groups covered many disciplines; Art accountable for service delivery even though had only indirect control of assets; smaller processes (business opportunity analyses, standards planning) not represented; technology experts scattered. Conclusion: structuring by internal processes extremely costly way to optimize workflows; no need to put diverse professions under common boss just to get them to work together.

8 Types of Synergies from Clustering Similar Professions:

| # | Synergy | Description | Warning if Scattered |
|---|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Professional Synergies | Professional exchange (sharing experiences, best practices); reduces redundant learning curves | People relearn and reinvent; lower productivity and quality |
| 2 | Management Synergies | Manager focused on similar professions better understands how to manage; better mentor | Boss may not understand function; mentoring weak |
| 3 | Workload Synergies | Larger pool can manage peak loads; borrow from closely related disciplines | Small group finds it difficult to manage peak loads |
| 4 | Negotiating Power | More buying power; better deals from suppliers; share tools and vendor services | Each group procures own tools; buying power diminished |
| 5 | Career Paths | Larger group offers better career opportunities; supervisory positions provide promotional opportunities | Staff find it difficult to advance; career requires leaving field |
| 6 | Domain Adjudication | Common manager resolves boundary issues; reduces overlaps and gaps | Domains only meet at level of top executive; result = overlaps and gaps |
| 7 | Simplicity | Easier for others to understand structure and find source of needed products/services | Harder to know where to go; creates confusion |
| 8 | Product Synergies | Similar professionals collaborating → better-integrated products | Tendency for each group to go own way; product dis-integration |

Implications: cluster by professional synergies (not who works with whom); put all staff sharing common profession under common boss; cluster similar specialties to maximize professional synergies.

## Principle 7: Business Within a Business

Every manager is entrepreneur whose job is to satisfy customers (internal and external) with products and services. Common mistake: holding people accountable for implementing specialties rather than for producing results.

Safety group case study: local water district, Randy (operations/repairs) + Barry (safety/environmental compliance). Safety group did inspections, supervised hazard handling, oversaw work. Work crews not trained in safety (Safety group supposed to handle it). Incidents 5-7× average; fines 3-5× average; 80-person Safety group requesting additional 20 staff (best practices: just 5-10 safety experts establishing policies and training). Conclusion: safety is attribute of people's work, not product in itself; everybody must run safe businesses. Safety group should provide training and consulting, not "implement safety."

What entrepreneurs love — Empowerment: "owning my time," "work as I wish within my professionalism," "control over decisions," "creativity — no limitations." Identity with results: "make things happen," "adventure of starting something," "building and creating value," "setting my own goals and reaching them." No reason can't create these same motivational forces inside large organizations at every level.

Business-within-a-business paradigm does NOT mean: profit centers; chargebacks; arm's-length relationship. Simply means: every manager thinks and acts like entrepreneur running own little business; every group understands purpose is to "sell" products and services to customers; entrepreneurs define their catalog of products/services and know their customers; most every business has competition — even internal service providers can lose monopoly by behaving as monopolist. Terms: shared services, intrapreneurship — all imply empowered, entrepreneurial organizations.

Entrepreneurial mindset benefits:

| Trait | Behavior |
|-------|---------|
| Customer focus | "Those are my customers, not unruly children" |
| Results orientation | "It's my product line; I'm accountable for everything I promise" |
| Quality | "I'm proud of my work; it's my job to make it best" |
| Efficiency | "I have to be best deal in town" |
| Teamwork | "I get help from peers when I need other specialties" |
| Risk-taking | "I take some risks to keep up with competition; but thoughtfully" |
| Use of vendors | "If buying more cost-effective than building internally, I'll propose it" |
| Innovation | "I've got to stay ahead of competition; so I'd better innovate" |

Why not "Partners": (1) "We share everything" — respective authorities/accountabilities unclear; shared accountability = no accountability; (2) "We're the experts" — "we know what's best for you" attitude erodes relationships; fundamentally disempowering. Better form: Customer-Supplier Relationships — suppliers respect customers' rights to make purchase decisions; present options, let customers decide. Matching A&A: customers have authority to decide what they'll buy, accountable for justifying utilization and realizing benefits; suppliers have authority to decide how they'll produce results, accountable for reliable delivery at competitive costs. Benefits: clean, mutually respectful, synergistic relationships.

Proactive entrepreneurship: market value of products/services; proactively meet with customers to discover challenges; offer alternative solutions; help customers analyze alternatives in context of customers' values (consultative: "If speed most important, pick A; if costs matter more, select B"); facilitate enterprisewide decisions; invest in own businesses; evolve product lines; reduce costs and improve quality. Entrepreneurs respect that customers know businesses best and must have authority to decide what they "buy."

Implications: define groups as lines of business, bounded by products and services they produce. Designing healthy structure = dividing organization's various products and services among groups, laying out mosaic of entrepreneurships.

## Building Blocks of Organization Charts

Engineering science comprises both principles and components. Building Blocks are "components" that assemble into organization chart. Five Building Blocks (types of businesses), each with sub-categories. Same Building Blocks appear in every industry (corporations, not-for-profit, higher education, governments) and within departments inside enterprises. Most salient: Principle 7 — Building Blocks should be lines of business. Help avoid gaps (Principle 3 — checklist of all possible lines of business). All Building Blocks important; all should be creative, customer-focused, entrepreneurial.

Two cautions: (1) this is NOT a prescribed organization chart — just provides language to describe org charts; (2) names may sound familiar but today's "Engineering" department may be combination of multiple Building Blocks.

Pick any industry, see two very different kinds of businesses:

| Engineers | Service Providers |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Boeing | Airline |
| Ford | Hertz |
| Building contractor | Hotel |
| IT applications developers | IT infrastructure services |

Engineers and Service Providers have differing competencies, business models, cultures, products/services — separate Building Blocks.

## Building Block: Engineers

Def.: Engineers create organization's products; discipline or technology specialists, designers, gurus. Maintain locus of expertise in specific engineering discipline, technology, or professional specialty. Use expertise to design, build, install solutions (physical asset, software, or intellectual property); also enhance, tune, repair, configure, support those solutions. Sell anything requiring in-depth expertise in design. Do not own solutions they produce; sell solutions to others (peers or external clients).

Services: solutions (new or enhancements), repairs, configuration tuning, domain-specific incident management (second-level support, escalation), documentation and training materials, expert time/studies/presentations/sales support.

| Industry | Engineers |
|----------|-----------|
| IT | Applications developers, infrastructure systems engineers |
| HR | Compensation/benefits design, performance-management systems design |
| Finance | Tax law, investment financial analysis |
| Product manufacturers | Product designers, manufacturing engineers |
| Health care | Outcomes management, doctors |
| Education | Schools and professors, curriculum and instructional design |
| Government | Policy and program design, decisions on grants |

Applications vs. Base Engineers: Applications Engineers assemble components into complete purpose-specific products (top layer). Base Engineers design components purpose-independent in that they serve multiple applications.

| Industry | Applications Engineers | Base Engineers |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| Automobiles | Car designers, truck designers | Engine, transmission, electrical system designers |
| Aerospace | Different kinds of airplanes | Engines, control systems, interiors |
| Higher education | Various schools (disciplines) | Curriculum and instructional design experts |
| IT | Data-object-specific software (financial, customer apps) | Computing platforms, database engines, middleware, telecommunications networks, end-user computing tools |

Engineers competencies:

| Dimension | Profile |
|-----------|---------|
| Bottom of T | Domain of technology, science, or discipline |
| Key methods | Design and testing, project management |
| Technical skill | High |
| Project management | High |
| Service management (operations) | Low |
| Business of customers | Low |
| Interpersonal skills | Low |
| People supervision | Medium |

Warning: if expected to produce anything other than solutions, depth in professional domain suffers. Engineers biases: love innovation; quickly bored with "keep it running" work; laser focused on domain; not experts in customers' businesses; cannot assess customers' needs in unbiased, business-driven manner.

| Conflict of Interests Dimension | Engineer Bias |
|---------------------------------|--------------|
| Invention vs. operational stability | Invention |
| Purpose-specific vs. components | Applications: purpose-specific; Base: components |
| Enterprisewide vs. specialist | Specialist |
| Technical specialization vs. unbiased diagnosis | Technical specialization |
| Service oriented vs. audit | Service oriented |

## Building Block: Service Providers

Def.: Service Providers deliver ongoing services; may buy products from Engineers, then use those assets to deliver service; or service may be delivered primarily by people. Distinguishing attribute: ongoing nature of services — essentially same routine service, day after day (think water flowing from spigot). Keep things running reliably, safely, efficiently.

Asset-based Service Providers: services based on ownership of assets; customers essentially buying use of those assets. Business model: find cases where customers can share use of asset; acquire infrastructure; use to produce services.

| Industry | Asset-based Services | People-based Services |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| IT | Computer time, data storage, connectivity | Service desk, field technicians, writers and trainers |
| HR | Benefits administration, employee data administration | Counseling, recruiting, onboarding, job grading |
| Finance | Accounting services, treasury | Procurement, customer service |
| Product manufacturers | Factories, warehouses, logistics | Customer service, field technicians |
| Health care | Hospital rooms, clinics, labs | Admissions, nursing, non-medical services |
| Education | Classrooms, residence halls, library | Registrar, admissions, student counseling |
| Government | Roads, parks, ports/airports, air traffic control | Social services, elections, weather forecasts |

Asset-based Service Providers: not technology specialists; rely on Engineers to build, upgrade, repair assets. Real expertise: providing services.

Three types of people-based Service Providers:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Product support | Help customers get value from organization's products | Help desk; training in use of organization's products |
| Internal support | Leverage time and enhance abilities of others | PMO (helps others manage projects); field technicians; technical writers |
| Business services | Services outside primary intent of organization | Administration, IT, Finance, HR departments (from CEO's perspective) |

Service Providers competencies:

| Dimension | Profile |
|-----------|---------|
| Bottom of T | Specific services and how they're produced |
| Key methods | Service delivery and management |
| Technical skill | Medium |
| Project management | Low |
| Service management (operations) | High |
| Business of customers | Low |
| Interpersonal skills | Asset-based: Low; People-based: High |
| People supervision | Asset-based: Medium; People-based: High |

Service Providers biases: responsible for stability, responsiveness, reliability, security, low cost. Major innovations inevitably disrupt smooth operations; biased to favor stability; change only when safe.

| Conflict of Interests Dimension | Service Provider Bias |
|---------------------------------|---------------------|
| Invention vs. operational stability | Operational stability |
| Purpose-specific vs. components | Agnostic |
| Enterprisewide vs. specialist | Specialist |
| Technical specialization vs. unbiased diagnosis | Unbiased |
| Service oriented vs. audit | Service oriented |

## Building Block: Coordinators

Def.: some things require consensus among stakeholders; Coordinators drive those shared decisions. Help stakeholders come to agreement on shared decisions (policies, plans, standards). Establish processes for decision making; ensure right stakeholders involved; provide common information; facilitate collaboration on interdependencies. Coordinators NOT accountable for content — participating stakeholders are; only accountable for effective consensus-based decision-making processes. Warning: giving Coordinators authority to force decision violates Golden Rule (not accountable for others' results).

Business-oriented Coordinators: (1) Strategy Planning Coordinator — expert in strategic planning methods; doesn't decide strategies, helps everybody decide own respective strategies in coordinated fashion; (2) Operational Planning Coordinator — expert in business and budget planning (especially investment-based budgeting); answers "What do we plan to deliver? How will we fulfill demand?"; (3) Research Coordinator — helps others do research; shares expertise in research methods; helps executive decide which research projects to fund as portfolio of investments (analogous to US National Science Foundation which distributes grants; does NOT do any research); (4) Organizational Effectiveness Coordinator — focuses on how organization does business (not what it produces): culture, structure, resource-governance processes, shared methods/tools, metrics and rewards; distinct from HR; leads transformation projects including restructuring; (5) Audit Response Coordinator — helps everybody respond to auditors and provides point of contact; offers voluntary "assessments" to help others prepare; (6) Regulatory Compliance Coordinator — provides expertise helping everybody comply with laws; point of contact for regulators; coordinates compliance examinations and remediation; (7) Business Continuity Coordinator — helps everybody develop own plans; coordinates interdependencies; coordinates tests of plan and execution if triggered; (8) Security Coordinator — expert in threats; helps everybody come to consensus on security policies; leads investigations; NOT audit function; NOT checking compliance; in IT = CISO.

Technical Coordinators: (1) Standards Coordinator — standards = conscious constraints on design permitting evolutionary change without loss of integration/interoperability; does not decide standards; creates framework and pulls together stakeholders to decide each "cell"; (2) Design Patterns Coordinator — expert in "ripples" (how decisions about one domain affect others); facilitates consensus on design guidelines; city planning analogy; in IT = combination of Standards + Design Patterns = "enterprise architect."

Function-Specific Coordinators: (1) Information Policy Coordinator (IT) — coordinates policies on information handling: retention, system-of-record, data ownership/access rights, privacy, acceptable use; (2) Employment Policy Coordinator (HR) — brings stakeholders to consensus on employment policies (compensation, talent management) to avoid inequities.

Coordinators competencies:

| Dimension | Profile |
|-----------|---------|
| Bottom of T | Topic being coordinated |
| Key methods | Consensus building, information structuring |
| Technical skill | Low (business) to Medium (technical) |
| Project management | Medium |
| Service management | Low |
| Business of customers | Low |
| Interpersonal skills | High |
| People supervision | Low |

Note: each Coordinator is expert in structure of content being coordinated; know enough to understand trade-offs but must not disempower others.

| Conflict of Interests Dimension | Coordinator Bias |
|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| Invention vs. operational stability | Invention |
| Purpose-specific vs. components | Agnostic |
| Enterprisewide vs. specialist | Enterprisewide decisions |
| Technical specialization vs. unbiased diagnosis | Unbiased |
| Service oriented vs. audit | Service oriented |

## Building Block: Sales and Marketing

Def.: client-facing part of organization; adds value in two ways: enhances organization's relationships with clients (default point of contact; facilitates effective communications); helps clients address challenges using organization's products and services. Sales staff help clients acquire just right products/services from organization's entire catalog. "Sell" here means help customers buy others' products (broker sales). Sales NOT accountable for delivery of other groups' products/services. Equally essential for internal service providers — have competition from decentralization and outsourcing.

Great salesmanship focuses on helping clients, not "pushing" products (also called strategic/consultative/partnership selling). Great relationships built by recognizing what's unique about each client, understanding business challenges, connecting with right suppliers. Sales proactively meets with key clients to discover ways organization can help. Internal Marketing helps clients understand organization's value; also helps internal service provider understand clients' needs through market research.

Decentralized Sales functions not advisable: often devolves into full-service support; treats centralized department as adversary; hard to balance workloads; difficulties introducing essential methods; often miss cross-business-unit opportunities.

Three types of Sales:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Account Sales | High-level reps for entire client accounts; proactively meet with selected client executives; produce strategic projects; very senior function — job grade should be as high as most senior leaders |
| Retail Sales | Not dedicated to specific accounts; territory is geographic; default point of contact for inquiries; may include business analysts converting opportunities into detailed requirements; reactive, available to anyone on demand |
| Function Sales | Experts in clients' professions or specific business processes; "second-tier" salesforce called in by Account and Retail Sales (ej. medical device manufacturer brings trained hematologist when demonstrating in hematology lab) |

Marketing: (1) Marketing Communications (one-to-many) — helps others communicate with clients; coordinates messages for consistency; branding, publications, advertising, direct communications, promotions, events; (2) Market Research (many-to-one) — inbound channel; serves as window to entire client community; answers what clients think/want/need/will buy; ranges from satisfaction surveys to market-demand forecasting models.

| Dimension | Sales Profile | Marketing Profile |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| Bottom of T | Clients, their business strategies, linkage to organization's products/services | — |
| Key methods | Opportunity identification, requirements planning, relationship management, benefits estimation, contract brokerage | Market communications, marketing strategy, market research |
| Business of customers | High | — |
| Interpersonal skills | High | — |

| Conflict of Interests Dimension | Sales and Marketing Bias |
|---------------------------------|------------------------|
| Invention vs. operational stability | Agnostic |
| Purpose-specific vs. components | Agnostic |
| Enterprisewide vs. specialist | Account: Specialist in clients; Others: Enterprisewide |
| Technical specialization vs. unbiased diagnosis | Unbiased |
| Service oriented vs. audit | Service oriented |

## Building Block: Audit

Def.: includes more than traditional financial and compliance auditors; any function that inspects and judges others, and reports results to someone other than those being inspected. May even have authority to block others (veto) — only Building Block with such power. Audit distinguished from service-oriented Building Blocks: delivers findings to someone other than people being judged; people being judged are NOT their customers. Epic failure of Arthur Anderson: misunderstanding this. 2008 financial crisis partly caused by rating agencies paid by banks whose securities they judged.

Distinction from assessments: assessment = voluntary (requested by manager; results reported back to those inspected). Audit = imposed; results reported to someone other than those being judged.

Audit is control mechanism of last resort; far more expensive, less effective than systemic controls. Situations requiring Audit: (1) customers can't perceive differences in product quality (e.g., food contamination — government inspects food producers); (2) employees have ability to gain personally by sacrificing well-being of organization (potential fraud).

Scope: mission strictly to uncover problems. Must NOT recommend corrective actions (expertise in finding problems doesn't qualify them to design solutions; if they recommended solutions, might judge more harshly solutions that don't match their recommendation). Must NOT disempower managers by setting objectives or giving orders; order to comply must come through chain of command.

| Dimension | Profile |
|-----------|---------|
| Bottom of T | Topic being judged |
| Key methods | Audit process |
| Technical skill | High |
| Project management | Medium |
| Service management | Low |
| Business of customers | Low |
| Interpersonal skills | Medium |
| People supervision | Low |

| Conflict of Interests Dimension | Audit Bias |
|---------------------------------|-----------|
| Invention vs. operational stability | Operational stability |
| Purpose-specific vs. components | Agnostic |
| Enterprisewide vs. specialized expertise | Agnostic |
| Technical specialization vs. unbiased diagnosis | Specialization in topic of audits |
| Service oriented vs. audit | Audit |

Foundation: Audit not only distinct Building Block; to avoid conflicts of interests, must be kept entirely separate from all other service-oriented Building Blocks.

## Applying the Principles: Rainbow Analysis

Src: Paul Cezanne — "We live in a rainbow of chaos." First step: applying Building Blocks to organization chart. Rainbow Analysis: four questions to diagnose all problems designed into current org chart. Reveals strengths and weaknesses (who's set up to fight with whom, who's set up to fail). Can also examine proposed org chart before implemented. Warning: identifying structural problems not meant to accuse organization of failing; good people can overcome almost any structural dysfunction; Rainbow Analysis only predicts potential problems, not actual failures.

Workshop process: highly interactive; facilitated Rainbow Analysis workshop for dozens of leadership teams (corporate, government, not-for-profit). Even if don't restructure, understand where problems coming from and why people struggling.

Data Collection: (1) get org chart (current or proposed) printed in poster size; (2) get set of 8+ colored marker-pens; (3) considering one Building Block at a time, interpret in context of organization's mission; (4) for each group in org chart, determine what Building Block(s) it represents; (5) circle each group and assign colors — one color per Building Block.

Four Diagnostic Questions:

1. Gaps: Are any colors missing? Any Building Block not represented in structure? Missing = accountability gap (nobody with daily job of thinking about that function); creates unreliable delivery, reduced specialization, overlapping domains.

2. Rainbows: Are any groups responsible for multiple Building Blocks (multiple colors)? Rainbows violate Principle 5 (conflicts of interests); result = gaps in performance, unpredictable balance, stress. Necessary only for very small organizations or remote locations.

3. Scattered Campuses: Is any color found in multiple groups? Splits profession; reduces specialization; redundant efforts; domain overlaps; product dis-integration; less innovation; more stress; confusion. Necessary only to balance workloads or manage remote locations.

4. Inappropriate Substructure: What's the "bottom of the T" for each group? Does basis for substructure match what function is supposed to be good at? Inappropriate substructure leads to reduced specialization, domain overlaps, inappropriate biases, disempowerment.

## Special Situations

Self-managed groups: when groups too small to warrant dedicated manager; can be self-managed as team. Foundation: self-managed groups not goal in themselves; simply way of treating situations that warrant structural separation but not manager; approach should be used with caution.

Shared People — Temporary Duty: sometimes appropriate for one manager to loan individual to another (term borrowed from military). When needed: (1) individuals with skills beyond their group's domain ("rainbow" people) — better to loan than to expand group's domain; (2) move portions of headcount between groups as workloads shift ("load balancing"). Mechanics: all accountability for work remains with receiving group; receiving managers may pay individual's salary for that period; if situation permanent, individual holds two part-time jobs reporting to two managers; two managers must agree on allocation of time; individual should have "home" group administratively accountable for performance appraisals (other manager contributes in proportion to time spent).

Remote Locations:

| Option | Description | Warning/Foundation |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1: Rainbow Groups | Create "rainbow" group combining all Building Blocks; similar to decentralization | Has all disadvantages of silo; reduces specialization; sets bad precedent. Generally should be avoided — with internet and collaborative tools, rare in most businesses |
| 2: Site Coordinators | Each specialist reports to appropriate manager at central location; most senior remote person appointed "site coordinator" for location-specific issues | Site coordinator duties distinct from client-liaison function; over-and-above normal functional responsibilities |
| 3: Technician Services | Remote group deemed "Technician Services" (People-based Service Provider); technicians sell time acting as "eyes and hands in field"; all technical direction from subject-matter experts who hire them | Doesn't work for Account Sales or Coordinators — these must be delivered centrally |
| 4: Temporary Duty | If predominant function in location, manager and staff may report to that function; other functions fulfilled by any staff on loan to other groups | — |

Project Management Office: excellence in project management essential for reliable delivery. Warning: PMO that manages projects (Kathy case — accountable for big/complex projects while Fred's group just "body shop") creates disempowerment, quality issues, demoralization, and conflict. Effective PMO is People-based Service Provider, accountable for delivering project planning and facilitation services; helps everyone succeed at respective projects without assuming project leadership or accountability for results.

Compliance and Governance: "Compliance" = ensuring organizations follow rules. "Governance" = all processes coordinating and controlling organization's resources and actions. Too often, executives assume governance means person or committee with authority to control others. Chief Compliance Officer case (Allison): three factors working against approach: (1) others not accountable for compliance; (2) others accountable for business results — not going to compromise missions to help Allison; (3) others don't need to worry about compliance (Allison's problem) → Allison becomes "Chief Scapegoat." When everybody accountable for own compliance: organization needs compliance officer as Coordinator — expert in how regulations affect organization; point of contact for regulators; helps individual managers put together policies and plans; brings stakeholders to consensus on shared policies; teaches others regulatory requirements and risks. Scapegoat trap: Security group (accountable for security rather than helping everyone operate securely), business continuity (unilaterally designs plan), quality assurance (takes accountability for quality through inspection/control). Total Quality Management principle: quality is attribute of product or service, not separate deliverable.

## Workflows: Teamwork Processes

Src: Henry Mintzberg — "Structure of organization can be defined simply as sum total of ways in which labor divided into distinct tasks and... coordination achieved among these tasks." Teamwork not luxury; essential aspect of organizational design; can't specialize if can't team (Principle 2). Organizations not good at teamwork create silo groups; groups inevitably evolve into silos of self-sufficient generalists.

Randy's failed approaches to improve teamwork: (1) Team-building — one-day seminar; three-day resort retreat; back on job, nothing changed; (2) Job Rotations — leaders developed empathy; but former head of infrastructure still requested money to upgrade development servers; lasted ~3 months before everyone put back; (3) Process Engineering — ITIL, DevOps, Lean-Six Sigma; processes defined tasks but no one accountable for results; "process owners" violated Golden Rule; organization became more bureaucratic, less flexible; (4) Forced Consolidation — mandated reorganization; unified help desk transferred calls to three "level-two" help desks; development servers moved to computer center but applications developers insisted on managing themselves; reliability and security issues remained.

Foundation: better organization is at cross-boundary teamwork, more can afford to specialize and optimize performance; must invest in mechanisms of teamwork. Investing in teamwork ≠ team-building; effective cross-boundary teamwork depends on explicit mechanisms for forming and coordinating teams.

## Benefits and Cultural Transformation

Building high-performance organization takes meticulous planning; transformational, participative process adds to leaders' workloads; process stressful (people worry about careers, status, power).

Sources of Efficiencies: overlaps eliminated (time saved by eliminating redundant efforts, territorial disputes); role clarity permits greater span (with clear domains, groups self-directed to far greater extent → flatter organization, reduced supervisory workloads); professional collaboration encouraged (bringing together related specialties → more professional exchange, reduced redundant research, accelerated learning, improved productivity, more reusable components).

Caution: don't use efficiency gains to justify restructuring initiative → may create expectations of reduced budgets and headcount. In practice, efficiencies reinvested in: catching up on training/innovation/planning/relationship building, improving quality/reducing risks, deferred maintenance, responding to backlogs/pent-up demand, filling gaps. Efficiencies develop gradually over time, not instantly upon announcement.

Effectiveness more important than efficiency. Reducing headcount by one might save $100K/year; but greater effectiveness means one more strategic project each year → benefits could be counted in millions.

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Gaps eliminated | Assigning accountability for missing lines of business delivers value not available from old organization; creating new Sales function improves relationships and strategic alignment |
| Specialization increases | Greater focus and specialization → improved productivity, faster delivery, higher quality, lower risk, more innovation, less stress |
| Accountabilities clear | Results-orientation delivers results; easier to know where to go; facilitates performance management |
| Teamwork enhanced | Best talent from wide range of specialties contributes to each project; produces far better results than generalists working alone |
| Organization scalable | Easier to grow, take on new technologies/missions, integrate acquisitions; possible to design structure that lasts lifetime |
| Executive bottleneck eliminated | Empowered staff don't need to be micro-managed; executives can focus on strategic challenges |

Cultural impacts of healthy structure — Empowerment: when jobs defined by what people "sell" (results), staff can be empowered to produce results as they see fit; improves reliable delivery; encourages creativity, innovation, quality (staff fully responsible; incentive to do things right first time — core TQM principle). Customer Focus: staff recognize funded to serve customers; focus on delivering products/services; build effective working relationships. Entrepreneurship: everybody is entrepreneur; know have to be reliable to stay in business; continually seek new opportunities to add value; optimize costs and methods; plan future of businesses.

## Key Takeaways

| Foundation | Statement |
|------------|-----------|
| Structure matters | Affects every aspect of organizational performance (efficiency, effectiveness, culture) |
| Seven Principles | Golden Rule, Specialization and Teamwork, Precise Domains, Basis for Substructure, Avoid Conflicts of Interests, Cluster by Professional Synergies, Business Within Business |
| Five Building Blocks | Engineers, Service Providers, Coordinators, Sales/Marketing, Audit — common language for analyzing and designing organizations |
| Rainbow Analysis | Diagnostic method reveals structural problems: Gaps, Rainbows, Scattered Campuses, Inappropriate Substructure |
| Teamwork essential | Essential complement to organization chart; can't specialize if can't team |
| Special situations | Self-managed groups, shared people, remote locations, PMO, compliance — all addressable without compromising Principles |
| Implementation | Requires participative process, careful planning, patience; benefits develop over time |
| Lasting structure | Well-designed structure lasts lifetime, evolving naturally without need for major restructuring |

Organizational structure not just boxes on chart; comprehensive system encompassing organization chart, domains, teamwork processes, culture, resource-governance. Science of structure based on timeless principles, not fads or fashions; apply across industries, functions, cultures, organization types. Structure enables or constrains everything organization does; good people can overcome bad structure but at great cost; well-designed structure multiplies effectiveness of every person. Investment in getting structure right pays dividends forever; structure embodying Principles becomes self-sustaining, self-correcting system. Leaders must become students of organizational science; understand principles, apply diagnostic methods, invest in proper design and implementation. Structure not one-time project; ongoing stewardship responsibility; leaders must continually reinforce principles, resist pressures to compromise, help organization evolve within framework.
