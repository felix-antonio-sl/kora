# Principle-based Organizational Structure

## Document Overview

- **Purpose:** Handbook for engineering entrepreneurial thinking and teamwork into organizations of any size.
- **Audience:** Leaders, executives, managers responsible for organizational design.
- **Nature:** Engineering science applied to organizational structure.

## Core Thesis

- **Mission:** Enable leaders to design high-performance organizational structures based on scientific principles.
- **Foundation:** Organizational structure is engineering science with firm principles and constructs.

### Fundamental Premise

**Organizational Machine**

- Definition: Organization as machine that either achieves vision or frustrates ambitions.
- Source: Sergio Paiz — "Most managers focus on operating poorly designed machine, struggle with it, rather than stepping back and redesigning machine."
- Example — Google case:
  - Bill Coughran, SVP Engineering 2003–2011, built Google's "engine room."
  - Knew Google File System (GFS) would have to be replaced within couple of years.
  - Objective: Build organization capable of innovating continually over time.
  - Foundation: Role of leader of innovation is not to set vision and motivate others to follow it; but to create community willing and able to generate new ideas.

**Three Strategic Vectors**

Great leaders pursue three parallel strategic vectors simultaneously:

| Vector | Definition |
|---|---|
| Market Vector | Alignment with customers |
| Technical Vector | Product/service capabilities |
| Organizational Vector | The machine itself |

This document addresses organizational strategy.

### Power of Structure

- Key elements of organizational design: structure, culture, resource-governance processes, methods, metrics.
- **Structure is most powerful of all elements.**
- Structure definition: Organization chart defining everybody's domains, and processes combining those specialists on teams.

## Benefits and Symptoms

### Benefits of Healthy Structure

- Individual accountabilities for results clear; people deliver results.
- Staff focused on excellence in single profession; perform better.
- Staff customer focused; relationships with clients improve; organization well aligned with clients' needs and strategies; synergies across clients' businesses discovered.
- Teams form spontaneously; work well together in flexible, well-defined processes tailored to needs of specific projects and services.
- Organization delivers commitments reliably, more quickly, with lower risk.
- Costs competitive; redundancies eliminated; internal entrepreneurs accountable for offering best value.
- Product quality increases; product line better integrated.
- Staff creative and entrepreneurial; pace of innovation in every discipline improves.
- Organization great place to work; staff empowered; conflicts of interests eliminated; jobs don't expect impossible.
- Structure lasting; not designed around incumbent personalities; defines accountabilities for all domains (current and future); automatically evolves as strategies and technologies change.
- Well-designed organizational structure contributes directly to shareholder value.

### Symptoms of Poor Structure

- Unclear individual accountabilities; staff task- or process-focused rather than results-focused; confusion about who does what; redundant efforts; territorial disputes; internal competition.
- Poor performance; people going too many ways at once; jobs too big for most people to succeed.
- Lack of customer focus; weak or strained relationships with clients; initiatives product- or technology-driven rather than business-driven.
- Difficulties with cross-boundary teamwork; slow response to new challenges; organization of independent silos.
- Slow or unreliable delivery.
- High costs; lack of concern for frugality; empire building.
- Poor quality; poorly integrated product line.
- Lack of entrepreneurial spirit; staff not creative; don't take initiatives to improve functions.
- Lagging in innovation; lack of accountability for planning and creating future.
- Low morale and motivation; disempowerment; dead-end jobs; cynicism; stress.
- Repeated restructurings, each fixing some problems and creating others.

**Results:** Unhealthy structure is not "supplier of choice" to customers nor "employer of choice" to staff. Stressful place to work; tough to lead; little time for strategic thinking.

## Science of Structure

Foundation: Organizational structure is engineering science, not matter of personalities, politics, personal style.

### Definition of Science

- Definition: Observation, identification, description, experimental investigation, theoretical explanation of phenomena. (American Heritage Dictionary)
- Nature: Applied science with firm principles and constructs.
- Context: Organizations are systems; present engineering challenge.

### Evolution of Science

- Process: Real-world empirical observations revealed patterns, generalized to principles and frameworks, tested over decades of actual implementation.
- Result: Principles now so clear that one can look at any organization chart and know who's fighting with whom, who's not making objectives, who has ulcers.

### Common Guidance Without Science

When executives don't study science of structure, reorganizations guided by:

- Incumbents' personalities and careers; attempts to work around managers who don't do essential aspects of jobs.
- Overly simplistic models (like "build versus run") or industry fads (like matrix).
- Client pressures (such as groups dedicated to them).
- Today's work, priorities, strategies.
- Intuition.

Result: Structure evolves through series of incremental changes by different executives, each with own philosophies and exigencies; resembles patchwork quilt of mismatched pieces.

### Reasons to Study Science

**Avoid Organization du Jour**
- Without guiding principles, each restructuring solves some problems while creating others.
- Warning: Never-ending, painful, costly series of disruptions; staff endure endless stream of unsettling changes; little real difference.
- Science helps engineer organization charts systematically, making deliberate decisions about key trade-offs.
- Principle-based structure dynamically adapts to changes in world; lasting investment; repeated reorganizations not required.

**Easier to Explain**
- Makes it easier to explain how things supposed to work.
- Easier for staff to understand; more likely to make it work as intended.
- With clear principles, executive can invite participation from leadership team without fear of endless haggling and parochial politics.
- Participation takes advantage of people's in-depth knowledge; builds deep understanding; engenders tremendous commitment.

**Don't Blame People**
- Leaders have moral obligation to study science of structure.
- Critical to know difference between poorly performing person and good person in poorly designed job.
- Example — University case:
  - Sondra hired to enhance corporate "outreach" (sales) and build "School of Continuing Studies."
  - Sondra succeeded at sales: increased revenues by nearly $4 million in one year.
  - Sondra failed at second objective: came up with own plan inconsistent with University's processes.
  - Cause: Coordinating enterprisewide initiatives requires competencies quite different from sales.
  - Conclusion: Sondra's failure not because she was poor performer; because structure gave her two very different jobs. President studied science of structure and saw real problem before firing great sales leader.
- Warning: Futile and cruel to blame people for poor performance when structure is root cause.

**New Levels of Performance**
- Source: Preston Simons, CIO at Aurora Health Care, former CIO at Abbott Laboratories.
- Led organizations from hundreds of employees regionally to thousands globally; implemented these principles in each case.
- Result: Powerful, yet pragmatic approach consistently leads to improved role clarity; better teamwork; customer focus; entrepreneurship; improved performance; commitment.

## Insufficiency of Alternative Approaches

### Great People Alone Not Enough

**Common Argument (Informal Organization)**
- Working relationships formed despite structure create "informal organization" that really determines how things get done.
- Conclusion: Success depends simply on hiring and developing great people who work hard, work well together, "do what's right."
- Result: Leads to designing organizational structures around unique talents or career needs of key executives.

**Problems with This Approach**

| Problem | Description |
|---|---|
| Constant Restructuring | Must restructure whenever anyone changes jobs; each restructuring disruptive and expensive |
| Fragility | Organizations depending only on great people require altruism, which is not natural or reliable; generally fall apart when executive who created team or key members leave |
| Impracticality | Organization requiring everyone above average difficult to staff; limited in growth potential |

**Reality Check**

- Superior people can overcome most structural dysfunctions, but inordinate amount of leaders' time, energy, goodwill spent resolving confusion and friction.
- Example — Large airline case:
  - IT divided into two computer centers: business systems and reservations system.
  - Systems-engineering manager reported to operations director (paid to keep things running, rewarded for stability).
  - Three successive systems-engineering managers fired for failure to innovate.
  - All three were bright, experienced people. Problem: structure set them up to fail.
  - Conclusion: If structure causing people to do wrong things, "better" people will just do wrong things faster.
- Great people in bad structure will fail, or at least not perform to potential.
- Normal bell-curve of people in healthy structure can succeed.
- Great organizations are, by design, those where average people can succeed, and super-achievers can super-succeed.

### Great Processes Alone Not Enough

**Common Argument (Process Engineering)**
- Carefully engineered business processes are key to success.
- As long as everybody does their part in well-designed processes, organization will perform well.

**Problems with This Approach**

| Problem | Description |
|---|---|
| Process Effectiveness Depends on Structure | If nobody specializes in given discipline, processes depending on that competency will fail |
| Structure Can Override Processes | When staff caught between conflicting forces, they optimize performance appraisals, even if some processes fail |
| Rigidity | In functions where projects have unique requirements, predefined processes make organization more rigid and less creative |

**Conclusion:** Great people working with great processes can't perform well unless structure they live in is well designed.

### Structure Drives Performance

- Structure is foundation on which good people and processes thrive.
- Structure is one of most powerful drivers of organization's performance: efficiency, effectiveness, agility, quality, creativity, innovation, competitiveness, customer satisfaction.
- Structure is key element of staff's competence, job satisfaction, motivation, commitment, happiness, loyalty.

## Seven Fundamental Principles

Foundation: Seven Principles provide foundation for science of structure.

| Principle | Statement |
|---|---|
| Principle 1 | Golden Rule: Authority and accountability must match. |
| Principle 2 | Specialization and Teamwork: You can only be world-class at one thing at a time; but you can't specialize if you can't team. |
| Principle 3 | Precise Domains: Define clear boundaries with no overlaps or gaps. |
| Principle 4 | Basis for Substructure: Divide function into groups based on what it's supposed to be good at. |
| Principle 5 | Avoid Conflicts of Interests: Don't expect people to go in two opposing directions. |
| Principle 6 | Cluster by Professional Synergies: Cluster groups under common boss based on similar professions. |
| Principle 7 | Business Within a Business: Every manager is entrepreneur whose job is to satisfy customers (internal and external) with products and services. |

### Principle 1: Golden Rule — Authority and Accountability Must Match

Most important principle; absolutely essential to success of every organization.

**Statement:** Authorities and accountabilities must match.

#### Consequences of Violation

**Authority Without Accountability**
- Person with authorities but not matching accountabilities becomes unconstrained tyrant.
- Can make decisions without bearing consequences; can tell others what to do while others held accountable for results.
- Without checks and balances, they do as they please.

**Accountability Without Authority**
- Those with accountabilities but insufficient authorities are disempowered and can't get jobs done.
- People cannot be held accountable for results if they don't have resources and authorities necessary to achieve those results.
- Warning: Trying to hold staff accountable for things they can't control won't lead to good performance; only establishes scapegoat to blame.
- Over time, disempowered people adopt helpless "victim" mentality, take no initiatives.

#### Case Studies

**Process Owners Case**
- CIO appointed "process owners" with authority over processes but without matching accountability for effectiveness.
- Result: Process owners had authority without accountability; everybody else had accountability without authority.
- Service-delivery groups took blame when services failed, even if failure was due to bad process.
- Organization became bureaucratic, slow, inflexible.

**CFO Mandates Others' Budgets**
- CFO held accountable for company's financial targets, but not for business results.
- Cuts others' budgets with little regard for impacts; rewarded for cost savings, not blamed for poor performance caused throughout rest of company.

**Customer Service Held Accountable for Resolving Incidents**
- Customer-service manager held accountable for resolving problems, not just coordinating resolution.
- Manager didn't have resources or authorities to solve many problems.
- Those who created problems not held accountable for remediating them.
- Result: Resolution impeded; customers' satisfaction suffered.

#### Healthy Organization Model

- Everybody is "process owner" for own products and services.
- Everybody accountable for frugality, not just CFO.
- Everybody accountable for resolving any problems they create, not just customer-service group.

#### Empowerment

- Empowerment means everybody accountable for own results, has authority over all information, resources, decisions needed to do jobs.
- Empowerment does not mean anarchy; not blank check whereby people can do whatever they please.
- With accountability comes equal measure of authority (and freedom).
- People must be given no more authorities than warranted by accountabilities.
- Fixed-sum equation: if anyone has more authorities than accountabilities, somebody else has less.
- Empowerment fundamental to employee motivation; hard to feel good if treated as child and told what to do all time.

#### Empowerment at Every Level

- Empowerment not limited to senior managers; everyone (in every job, at every level, in every corner of organization) should be empowered to manage their piece of business.
- If subordinates inexperienced, empower them in smaller chunks (series of small assignments, each within capabilities).
- Even relatively junior people can be empowered with authorities matching accountabilities.

#### Mandating "How" Instead of "What"

- Organizations should hold people accountable for results, leave them free (within bounds) to decide how to attain those results.
- Example — SOx Compliance Waste:
  - Wallace claimed close to one-third of costs of major ERP implementation projects wasted in name of SOx compliance — 50% increase in project costs.
  - Cause: Waste resulted from requirement to do all IT documentation in specific way (UML); ERP vendor documentation didn't fit neatly into required format.
  - IT leadership drove costs sky-high when issued edict dictating "how" as well as "what."
- Example — Project-Management Method:
  - Standard method may be too cumbersome for small agile projects, or insufficiently robust for really complex projects.
  - If people perform poorly, unclear if their fault or fault of imposed method.
- Distinction: Not disempowering to clearly define every aspect of "what" (artifacts like documentation, project status reports). Is disempowering to require specific "how."

#### Leader's Role in Empowered Organization

Specific authorities and accountabilities of leaders:

- Decide rules of game (create organizational ecosystem: structure, resource-governance processes, culture).
- Once right structure in place, adjust domains as needed, arbitrate boundary disputes, ensure teamwork occurring as it should.
- Develop talent within group (recruiting, inspiring, coaching subordinates). Note: coaching offered as advice which staff may or may not choose to follow.
- Manage performance (negotiating staff's objectives, giving frequent feedback, measuring results, deciding rewards, managing performance problems).
- Manage commitments and resources (assigning work within group).
- Coordinate shared decisions within group (decisions on common methods and tools, agreements on professional practices).
- Make decisions where consensus cannot be reached.
- Guide business and product (technology) strategies within group.
- Serve as diplomat, representing group to peers and superiors.

**Leader's job summary:** Create right environment, do everything possible to help subordinates succeed.

**Control in empowered organization:** Managing by results can give more, not less, control. Focus moves up from micro-managing to more leveraged level of orchestrating right results. Instead of being cog in machine, leader becomes driver of machine.

#### Implications for Structure

- Define jobs based on what people produce, not by how they do work (processes, methods, tools, tasks).
- Job descriptions should be phrased in terms like "accountable for delivering," not "responsible for doing."
- Never create job whose purpose is to disempower others.
- Don't create steering committees or process owners ("integrating managers") who constrain others' prerogatives.
- If concerned about teamwork, far better answer is to install systemic processes that align everybody's priorities and link them on teams without disempowerment.

### Principle 2: Specialization and Teamwork

Definition: You can only be world-class at one thing at a time; but you can't specialize if you can't team.

#### Case Study: Customer-centric Structure

- CIO dedicated group to each client business unit; each group relatively self-sufficient, with all skills needed to deliver any applications requested by assigned business unit.
- Structure: Janice (Sales and Marketing), Bill (Finance), Henry (HR and other Corporate functions), Eugene (Engineering and Manufacturing), IT infrastructure and operations.

**Initial Success:**
- Clients felt IT more responsive; better understood business; better partnership developed.
- Clients could control priorities; more understanding when couldn't do everything.

**Problems Emerged:**
- Client-liaison function part-time job; not much time to spend with clients.
- Engineering sub-optimized: each technology sub-specialty scattered among various client-dedicated groups.
- Limited professional exchange; when staff ran into technical challenges, might not have known peers already figured out answer.
- Little impetus for standards; people built systems optimal for specific clients, not for enterprise.
- Reduced engineers' ability to specialize; costs rose, quality suffered, response times slowed.
- Pace of innovation slowed; couldn't hire expert in emerging technology when only enough demand for one person shared across enterprise.
- Missed business opportunities (no specialists in web and mobile applications).
- Structure led to multiple general-ledger systems and multiple records for same customer.

**Conclusion:** Customer-aligned organization didn't deliver advantages of its size; performed no better than decentralized groups. Organization didn't deserve to stay together because wasn't adding value.

#### Why Organizations Exist

**Common Purpose Insufficient**
- For very simple tasks, common purpose might be enough.
- Example: 100 individuals each trying to make cars; each would have to be expert in virtually every branch of design, engineering, manufacturing. No one person can possibly know enough.
- Independent people agreeing to work toward common purpose solves problem of volume, but not of complexity.

#### Cybernetic Variety

- **Human Mind Limitations:** We can think only so many thoughts in day; we have finite number of "brain cycles" each day.
- **Cybernetics:** Study of dynamic systems (like thermostat that turns on heater when it gets too cold). Organizations can be viewed as large, complex cybernetic systems.
- **Variety Definition:** VARIETY = COMPLEXITY × PACE. Measure of throughput or bandwidth; amount and diversity of information confronting organization at any point in time.
- **Implication:** World around us swarming with immense variety, way too much for any one person to grasp.

#### Definition of Specialist

| Choice | Description | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Generalist | Know little bit about everything; jack of all trades | Able to do many things, but none particularly well |
| Extreme Specialist | Focus all variety-processing abilities on one topic | Excel at that one thing; wouldn't be able to work well with others |
| T-shaped Specialist | Focus on one profession, while still knowing little about lots of things | Practical specialist; definition of what works |

- **Cybernetics conclusion:** People can only be world-class experts at one thing at a time.
- Source: Niels Bohr — "An expert is person who has made all mistakes that can be made in very narrow field."

#### Why Organizations Exist — Answer

- Organizations exist to allow people to specialize.
- When T-shaped specialists in diverse range of fields work together, organization has both depth and breadth; can process more variety.
- Warning: Organization of generalists performs no better than equal number of individuals.
- Within some practical limits, more that people specialize, better they (and their organizations) perform.

#### Benefits of Specialization

Source: Adam Smith described advantages of "division of labor" in 1776.

| Benefit | Description |
|---|---|
| Productivity | Specialists more efficient; increased productivity translates into cost savings |
| Speed | With all experience, specialists have ready answers; don't have to climb learning curve |
| Quality | Specialists produce higher quality; products more usable, more capable, more maintainable |
| Risk | People with more competence and experience deliver results more reliably, with fewer risks |
| Innovation | Specialists can keep up with literature; first to learn about emerging technologies |
| Reduced Stress | Specialists experience less stress; confident of abilities; more productive, stable, happy |
| Motivation | With greater competence, easier to excel; better career opportunities |

**Conclusion: Specialists always outperform generalists.**

#### Concerns About Specialization

**Practical Limits**
- Organizations can't afford to specialize to point of becoming "one deep" (dependent for critical services on just one individual).
- Person may become bottleneck; problems when takes vacation or leaves company.
- Sometimes cross-training can address this; in other cases, structure must define domains more broadly.

**Job Narrowing Concern**
- Healthy specialization is not job narrowing.
- Specialists do everything in their field: work with customers; deliver today's work; support past work; keep up with innovations; plan and develop future offerings; improve their processes.

**Market Reality**
- Market rewards specialists, not generalists.
- Some resist specialization to avoid accountability for excellence in any one thing.

#### Specialization Requires Teamwork

- Organization made of specialists each acting independently without teamwork would perform terribly; worse than collection of independent generalists.
- No one specialist sees big picture; collectively unlikely to get anything done.
- More people specialize, more they become interdependent.
- **You can't specialize if you can't team.**
- If organization not good at cross-boundary teamwork, must back away from specialization so groups are independent rather than interdependent.
- Result: Must sacrifice performance to avoid teamwork. Leads to "silo" organization.

#### The Silo Organization

- Some leaders believe only way to get people to work well together is to put them under common boss.
- Result: Put all skills needed by function under its manager.
- **Silo definition:** Organization made up of groups that are self-sufficient and don't need to work together.
- Result: Each profession scattered among various groups; fragmentation reduces specialization; lower performance; benefits of specialization lost.
- Alternative: Antidote to silos is effective teamwork across boundaries. Just as managers have authority over external vendors, they can manage team-members in other groups who are assigned to them.

#### Implications for Structure

- More people specialize, better they perform; don't design jobs for generalists, or expect people to be experts at too many things; jobs should be designed around well-focused specialties.
- Can't specialize if can't team well across boundaries; more willing to invest in cross-boundary teamwork, more can specialize and better organization will perform.
- Organizations exist in order to allow people to specialize, which in turn depends on effective teamwork.

### Principle 3: Precise Domains

Definition: Define clear boundaries with no overlaps or gaps.

#### Domain Definition

- Organization chart determines everybody's "domains" (boundaries within which each group functions).
- Warning: When different people interpret domain words in different ways, three problems occur: overlaps, gaps, lack of focus.

#### Case Study: Vague Domains

- CIO put Rick in charge of "Infrastructure" group, Charlie managed "Enterprise Architecture" (EA).
- Charlie believed his job was to design infrastructure; proposed cutting-edge technologies.
- Rick fought that, designed own infrastructure because couldn't deliver reliable services with unstable technologies.
- Cause: Rick and Charlie fought because they were paid to fight; both believed they had authority over design of infrastructure.

#### Overlaps

- Definition: Lack of clarity may cause multiple groups to think they're responsible for same function.
- Result: When domains overlap, staff fight and compete with one another.

**Intentional Internal Competition**
- Some leaders create overlapping domains intentionally, thinking internal competition will elicit better performance.
- Warning: Internal competition should never be needed.
- For internal service providers, competition comes from vendors; outsourcing or benchmarking study can serve as wake-up call.

**Costs of Overlapping Domains**
- Reduced specialization: Splitting profession into multiple groups reduces specialization; lower productivity, slower delivery, lower quality, greater risk, less innovation, more stress.
- Redundant efforts: More than one group does same research, produces same kind of products; solutions reinvented rather than reused.
- Less innovation: When two groups study same thing, something else that one might otherwise have explored is missed.
- Confusion: When two groups offer same service, customers don't know where to go for what.
- Product dis-integration: Multiple, incompatible versions of same product can undermine enterprise synergies.
- Less teamwork: Internal competition may be friendly, but inevitable friction undermines teamwork.
- Lack of entrepreneurship: Whenever single line of business fragmented, no one feels "ownership."

**Conclusion:** Good structure defines distinct domains, with no overlapping boundaries.

#### Case Study: Gaps

- IT department had applications development groups, but no groups dedicated to lower-layer technologies.
- Jim, Donna, and Carey each developed expertise in sub-technologies outside core domain.
- When Jim needed reporting tool from Donna's group, her staff too busy with own projects.
- Whenever needed technology was missing, people muddled through; multiple learning curves and replication of efforts costly.
- No single leader had job of ensuring comprehensive range of supporting technologies available.

#### Gaps

- Definition: When function is missing, gaps occur.

**Results of Gaps**
- Unreliable delivery: With no one thinking about function on daily basis, it's "catch as catch can."
- Reduced specialization: Staff filling gap outside their specialty aren't experts; don't have time to learn that other profession.
- Overlaps: Gaps create overlaps; group that needs missing specialty fills gap for itself, then multiple groups fill same gap.

#### Focus

- When domains unclear, staff don't know what they're supposed to be good at; natural drive for excellence thwarted.
- May try to be good at too many things and become generalists; or may just follow personal interests.

**Benefits of Clear Domains**
- Give people focus they need to excel.
- Tell people what literature, which conferences, which methods and technologies, what research to study.
- Staff develop feeling of pride in their group's unique function.
- Clear domains basis for effective performance management.
- Both customers and staff need to know where in organization to go for help.

#### Case Study: Roles and Responsibilities

- Aaron (applications engineering), Mark (business analysts), Jay (PMO).
- CIO asked them to work out respective "roles and responsibilities."
- Who's responsible for project success? Both Aaron and Jay raised hands — shared accountability equivalent to no accountability.
- Jay pulled engineers out of Aaron's group; Aaron yanked engineers off Jay's projects.
- Three methods (requirements-planning, development, project-management) didn't mesh; required lots of paperwork for every hand-off.
- All set up to fail, with overlapping accountabilities and without authorities needed to deliver results.

#### RACI Framework Problems

| Element | Problem |
|---|---|
| Responsibilities | Defines accountabilities for tasks and processes, not results |
| Accountable | Person with authority may or may not be customer; risks separating authorities from accountabilities |
| Consulted | Fixed list of contributors lack accountability for results; may not be right for every project |
| Informed | Fixed list may or may not be right stakeholders; bureaucratic, not flexible and dynamic |

#### Downside of Jobs Designed Around Tasks

- People execute tasks; not asked to think creatively about how to attain intended results.
- Each group sub-optimizes (and perpetuates) its steps in current process.
- Boss who coordinates all tasks must plan every project in detail; busy managing tasks, doesn't have time to think about own challenges.
- When disempowered people interact with customers, both parties frustrated.
- People believe they've done enough if put in required hours and completed tasks, whether or not job is done.
- Roles and responsibilities don't define accountabilities for leadership (improving methods and tools, developing strategies).
- Problem with "roles and responsibilities": can sort tasks in excruciating detail, and still won't know who's accountable for delivering organization's products and services.

#### Domains Based on Results

- Organizations don't make money by going through motions; make money by producing results.
- Key to good domains: bounding what people produce rather than what they do.
- Dividing up results actually lot easier than sorting tasks; list of organization's products and services far shorter than all tasks people do.

**Example — Applications Manager:**
- Aaron is applications manager; accountable for entire portfolio of applications; single point of accountability.
- Mark's group produces requirements definitions (not product designs — that's engineering task).
- Jay sells project planning and facilitation services; whether or not Aaron's engineers get help from Jay, still accountable for delivering projects.
- Since each group only produces results within its domain, boundaries clear.

#### Implications for Structure

- Provide every group with precisely worded boundaries.
- Ensure no overlaps; never create internal competition.
- Ensure no gaps; place every needed specialty within domain of one group.
- Domains should bound what people produce, not roles they play or tasks they're responsible for.
- Clear domains take more than few words in box on organization chart; each box should be accompanied by carefully worded paragraph that clearly bounds what each group produces.

### Principle 4: Basis for Substructure

Definition: Divide function into groups based on what it's supposed to be good at.

Context: Organization big enough to require multiple groups in essentially same profession — how to divide all various deliverables among those multiple groups?

#### Case Study: Structure by Clients' Business Processes

- CIO dedicated groups to each of company's core processes:
  - Gail (product-development process), Jerry (order-to-invoice process), Tom (financial and administrative processes).

**Problems in Practice**

| Problem | Description |
|---|---|
| Redundant learning curves | All groups required many common skills; parallel learning curves increased costs and delayed projects |
| Redundant work | Both Gail and Jerry developed document-tracking modules |
| Reduced specialization | Groups became experts on clients' business processes, but generalists with regard to their own engineering discipline |
| Product dis-integration | Each group independently developed own versions of financial, customer, product databases; conflicting reports confused clients |
| Weak client relationships | Multiple points of contact per client; clients had to determine which workflow to discuss before knowing whom to call |
| Biased business diagnosis | Group dedicated to business process naturally biased in favor of automating that workflow; high-payoff opportunities missed |

#### Basis for Substructure Definition

- **Basis for substructure:** The way you divide domains among groups within a profession.
- **Determines people's specialties** (their bottom-of-the-T).

**Examples of Different Bases**

| Basis | Specialization | Generalism |
|---|---|---|
| Clients' business processes | Workflows | Clients, engineering disciplines, services |
| Clients (business units/territories) | Close to those clients | Organization's products and services |
| Technologies and disciplines | Those products | Clients |
| Services | Delivery of those services | Clients and products |

#### Consequences of Wrong Basis

- **Reduced specialization:** If basis anything other than function's expertise, staff will specialize in something other than their primary mission; lower productivity, slower delivery, lower quality, greater risk, less innovation, more stress.
- **Domain overlaps:** Inappropriate substructure often creates overlapping domains; confused clients; reinvention; product dis-integration.
- **Inappropriate biases:** Wrong basis can induce wrong biases; staff give poor advice, optimize wrong objectives. Sales force divided by product lines can't be trusted advisors.
- **Disempowerment:** Two groups fulfilling essentially same function, one doing thinking while other does delivery; neither wholly responsible for results.

#### Implications for Structure

- Organization chart defines everybody's specialties (their "bottom-of-the-T").
- Use basis for substructure that exactly matches what people are supposed to be good at.
- There's no one right answer for entire organization; but for each specific function, right basis for substructure should be evident.
- If want engineers to be good at designing things, define their domains by what they design; if job of Sales is to know clients, define their domains by clients they serve.

### Principle 5: Avoid Conflicts of Interests

Definition: Don't expect people to go in two opposing directions.

Context: To support empowerment, Principle 3 states groups' domains should be defined by results they produce. What goes best with what? Two considerations: conflicts of interests (Principle 5) and professional synergies (Principle 6).

#### Case Study: Governance and Client Liaison Group

- CIO put Martha in charge of "Governance" group; responsibilities included business relationship managers, demand management (deciding priorities among proposed projects), PMO.

**Martha's Conflicts of Interests:**
- Had authority to decide project priorities; conflicts with business relationship management role which attempts to be on clients' side of table.
- Judging internal projects proposed by peers undermines service orientation expected in project management function.
- Since Martha's job was to limit demand, would business relationship managers be aggressive about seeking new high-payoff opportunities?
- Business relationship managers help some clients discover new opportunities; will projects that other clients define on own get fair treatment?
- Will discovery process recommend services as well as projects, despite bias toward projects from project-management function?
- Some high-payoff opportunities may be urgent; project-management function not going to like disruptions to well-planned project schedule.

#### Five Fundamental Conflicts of Interests

Definition: If put wrong deliverables together in single job, can inadvertently create conflicts of interests.

**Conflict 1: Invention Versus Operations**
- Definition: Invention (major innovations) versus operational stability.
- Combining invention and operations misguided: operational issues tend to take precedence; fire-fighting swamps invention; short-term problems take attention away from long-term opportunities.
- Example — George Case: Manager given both infrastructure operations and infrastructure engineering responsibilities. Made great progress stabilizing operations, but innovation stopped.
- Example — Telecommunications Cable Manufacturer: Executive given both business development (acquisitions) and operating acquired companies. After first major acquisition, had no time for new deals; CEO left without business development function.
- Note: Generally, conflict constrains invention; but in cases where leader prefers engineering, invention takes precedence and operations never stabilize.

**Conflict 2: Purpose-specific Solutions Versus Components**
- Definition: Some organizations produce two different kinds of products: purpose-specific, and components.
- Example — Construction industry: Architects design buildings; civil engineers design bridges; both draw on structural engineers, electrical engineers.
- Example — IT: Business applications purpose-specific; all draw on experts in component technologies (computing platforms, databases, middleware).
- Warning: If group expected to produce both, unhealthy bias built in; staff tend to put everything on familiar platforms.
- Example — PDC Bleach Operation: Distinguishing purpose-independent (base chemical) from purpose-specific (consumer bleach) products led to new source of revenues.

**Conflict 3: Enterprisewide Thinking Versus Focus of Specialist**
- Definition: Some decisions (policies, plans, standards) are enterprisewide, affecting many different stakeholders.
- Warning: If assigned to any one of impacted domains, decisions will tend to be biased in favor of that one stakeholder.
- Example — IT technology standards: If network standards decided by network engineers, may neglect interests of other engineers who must design compatible systems.

**Conflict 4: Product Specialization Versus Unbiased Diagnosis of Clients' Needs**
- Definition: Specialization brings quality, but also brings bias.
- Warning: If staff expected to do both (specialize and provide unbiased diagnosis), conflict of interests arises.
- Warning: As old saying goes, "Give child hammer, and everything looks like nail!" Despite best efforts to be objective, staff see only needs for their favored solutions.

**Conflict 5: Service Orientation Versus Audit**
- Definition: Primary mission of most functions is serving others; customer focus is key success factor.
- Warning: Mixing audit functions with service functions creates conflict of interests; impossible to build relationship with customers while also judging them.
- Example: Just can't say, "I'm from Internal Revenue Service; I'm here to help!"
- Example — IT: Giving PC group power to decide whether users need new PC; clients wouldn't perceive them as service oriented.

#### Consequences of Conflicts of Interests

- **Gaps:** With finite brain cycles, people might be mediocre at both missions; more commonly, prefer one (based on predilections) and performance at other mission falls short.
- **Unpredictable balance:** Balance between conflicting missions not deliberate process; people independently decide balance based on limited view; top executive has no knob to turn.
- **Stress:** When people expected to go in opposing directions, don't know what to do; highly stressful jobs lead to poor motivation, performance deficiencies, even health problems.

#### Implications for Structure

- Since organizations may face all these conflicts of interests, top executives inevitably must cope with these paradoxes and decide balance point on each.
- At lower levels, not healthy to combine functions with opposing objectives.
- Reserve conflicts of interests for highest possible level in organization chart, ideally for top executive alone.
- Healthy structure defines jobs that focus on only one side of each paradoxical dimension; allows executive to explicitly adjust balance by shifting resources between groups.

### Principle 6: Cluster by Professional Synergies

Definition: Cluster groups under common boss based on similar professions.

Context: As combine organization's many deliverables into domains, first consideration is avoiding conflicts of interests; second is professional synergies.

#### Case Study: Process-centric Groups

- CIO dedicated groups to each major process within IT: Ruth (applications development process), Bob (infrastructure engineering process), Matt (incident management process), Art (operational service delivery process).

**Problems:**
- With each group attempting to cover many engineering disciplines, all became less specialized; costs rose, quality suffered, pace of innovation slowed.
- Art forced to operate whatever infrastructure Bob developed; accountable for service delivery even though had only indirect control of own assets.
- Smaller, less-visible processes not represented in structure (business opportunity analyses, standards planning).
- Technology experts scattered among various groups didn't coordinate professional practices.

**Conclusion:** Structuring by internal processes extremely costly way to optimize workflows. As long as willing to invest in processes and teamwork, no need to put diverse professions under common boss just to get them to work together.

#### Clustering Similar Professions

Foundation: If don't have to put people under common boss to get them to work together, then free to cluster staff by their professions.

**8 Types of Synergies from Clustering**

| Synergy | Description | Warning if Scattered |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Professional Synergies | Encourages professional exchange (sharing experiences, discoveries, best practices); reduces redundant learning curves | People don't get together to learn; relearn and reinvent; wastes time; lower productivity and quality |
| 2. Management Synergies | Manager focused on similar professions better understands how to manage; better leader and mentor; appropriate sub-culture | Boss may not understand function; mentoring weak; harder to develop common methods |
| 3. Workload Synergies | Larger pool of staff can better manage workloads; borrow people from closely related disciplines | Small group of professionals finds it difficult to manage peak loads |
| 4. Negotiating Power | More buying power; can negotiate better deals from suppliers; share tools and vendor services | Each group procures own tools; buying power diminished |
| 5. Career Paths | Larger group offers better career opportunities; supervisory positions provide promotional opportunities | Staff find it difficult to advance; career path requires leaving field of study |
| 6. Domain Adjudication | Common manager resolves boundary issues; reduces chances of domain overlaps and gaps | Domains only meet at level of top executive; result typically domain overlaps and gaps |
| 7. Simplicity | Easier for others to understand structure and find source of needed products and services | Harder to know where to go; creates confusion |
| 8. Product Synergies | When similar professionals collaborate more, organization's products likely to be better integrated | Tendency for each group to go own way; product dis-integration; monolithic products |

#### Implications for Structure

- Cluster domains based on professional synergies (not who works with whom).
- Put all staff who share common profession together under common boss.
- If trust that will build processes of cross-boundary teamwork, no need to cluster functions based on who works with whom.
- Cluster similar specialties to maximize professional synergies.

### Principle 7: Business Within a Business

Definition: Every manager is entrepreneur whose job is to satisfy customers (internal and external) with products and services.

Warning: Common mistake is to hold people accountable for implementing their specialties.

#### Case Study: Safety Group Accountable for Safety

- Local water district: Randy (operations and repairs), Barry (safety and environmental compliance).
- Safety group did inspections, supervised handling of hazards, oversaw Operations staff while they worked.

**Problems:**
- Work crews weren't trained in safety, since Safety group supposed to take care of that.
- Sometimes work crews grew impatient waiting for Safety staff to show up, went ahead without them.
- Study found incidents five to seven times average, fines three to five times average.
- 80-person Safety group requesting additional 20 staff; best practices were just 5–10 safety experts dedicated to establishing policies and training workers.

**Conclusion:** Safety is attribute of people's work, not product in itself; everybody must run safe businesses and produce safe products. Safety group should have been in business of providing training and consulting to Operations, not "implementing safety."

#### Why Entrepreneurs Love Their Jobs

**What Entrepreneurs Said — Empowerment:**
- "...owning my time, choosing which hours I work."
- "I work as I wish to, within my own sense of professionalism and ethics."
- "...control over decisions."
- "I'm not good rule-follower; I like making my own rules."
- "...the creativity — there's no limitations on my ideas."

**What Entrepreneurs Said — Identity with Results:**
- "...make things happen."
- "...the adventure of starting something and getting it done."
- "...building and creating value."
- "...the sense of accomplishment."
- "...setting my own goals in life, and then reaching them."
- "I'm an artist of necessities; I love filling society's needs."
- "I want to be game-changer."

**Conclusion:** No reason can't create these same motivational forces (empowerment, identity with results) inside large organizations, at every level.

#### What It Means to Be a Business Within a Business

- Business-within-a-business paradigm does NOT mean operating internal service functions as profit centers; does NOT require chargebacks; does NOT imply arm's-length relationship.
- Simply means every manager thinks and acts like entrepreneur running own little business.
- Every group should understand its purpose is to "sell" its products and services to customers (whether or not money changes hands).
- Entrepreneurs should define their catalog of products and services, know whom their customers are.
- Most every business has competition; even if internal service providers seem to have monopoly, surest way to lose it is to behave as monopolist.
- Other terms: shared services, "intrapreneurship" — all imply same thing: empowered, entrepreneurial organizations.

#### Benefits of Business-Within-a-Business Paradigm

Business-within-a-business paradigm brings out best in people:

| Trait | Entrepreneurial Mindset |
|---|---|
| Customer focus | "I understand those are my customers, not unruly children" |
| Results orientation | "It's my product line; I'm accountable for delivering everything I promise" |
| Quality | "I'm proud of my work; it's my job to make it best" |
| Efficiency and cost control | "I have to be best deal in town" |
| Teamwork | "To stay competitive, I have to focus on my own domain; I get help from peers when I need other specialties" |
| Judicious risk-taking | "I have no choice but to take some risks to keep up with my competition; but I do so thoughtfully" |
| Use of vendors | "If buying something more cost-effective than building it internally, I'll be first to propose it" |
| Innovation | "I've got to stay ahead of my competition; so I'd better innovate" |

**What You Won't Hear:**
- "My job is to get budget at beginning of year, make sure it's used up by year end."
- "We're in public service; we're not business; so I don't have to listen to any customers."
- "My customer is enterprise as whole; I know what's best for you."

#### Why Not "Partners"

**Dangerous Definition 1: We Share Everything**
- "All for one, one for all" notion of partnership; respective authorities and accountabilities unclear.
- IT staff feel have right to tell clients how to run businesses.
- Clients feel have right to tell IT staff how to manage technology projects.
- Shared accountability equivalent to no accountability; without clearly defined individual accountabilities, team members struggle for control.

**Dangerous Definition 2: We're the Experts**
- "We are partners, and hence equals; and since we're IT experts, we'll decide what technologies you get."
- Opposite of customer focus; "we know what's best for you" attitude erodes relationships.
- Fundamentally disempowering: would be unfair to hold clients accountable for business results if can't control means of production.

#### Better Form of Partnership: Customer-Supplier Relationships

**Customer-Supplier Model:**
- Suppliers respect customers' rights to make purchase decisions; present options, then let customers decide.
- Customers decide what they'll buy; suppliers figure out how to produce it; choose own methods and tools.

**Matching Authorities and Accountabilities:**
- Customers have authority to decide what they'll buy; accountable for justifying utilization, paying all life-cycle costs, realizing benefits.
- Suppliers have authority to decide how they'll produce results; accountable for reliable delivery at competitive costs.

**Benefits:** Customer-supplier relationships clean and mutually respectful. Synergistic: only result from taking advantage of people's different strengths, assigning distinct authorities and accountabilities.

#### Proactive Entrepreneurship

Entrepreneurs strive to please customers; does not mean they're passive order-takers. Proactive in many ways:

- Market value of their products and services to lift customers' awareness of possibilities.
- Proactively schedule time to talk to customers about business challenges ("sales" in best sense of profession).
- Offer alternative solutions (as in Chevrolet, BMW, Rolls-Royce).
- Help customers analyze alternatives in context of customers' values; consultative process: "If speed most important to you, pick alternative A; but if costs more important, select B."
- Facilitate enterprisewide decisions (policies and standards); coordinate stakeholders' decisions on behalf of enterprise.
- Invest in own businesses (process improvements, technology innovation, new products).
- Proactively maintain and evolve infrastructure; acquire whatever need to satisfy customers' demands.
- Don't wait for customers to tell them to offer new products; proactively evolve product lines.
- Proactively reduce costs and improve quality.

**Summary:** In business-within-a-business paradigm, everybody is "product manager." As proactive as they are, there's line they don't cross: entrepreneurs respect that customers know businesses best, are accountable for business results; therefore, customers must have authority to decide what they "buy."

#### Implications for Structure

- Define groups as lines of business, bounded by products and services they produce (by what each "sells," not what it does).
- Designing healthy structure is matter of dividing organization's various products and services among its groups, laying out mosaic of entrepreneurships.
- This Principle creates empowered jobs, where staff are customer focused, accountable for results, creative and entrepreneurial, highly motivated.

## Building Blocks of Organization Charts

Source: Socrates — "The beginning of wisdom is the definition of terms."

- Engineering science comprises both principles and components.
- Building Blocks are "components" that can assemble into organization chart.
- Most salient to definition of Building Blocks is Principle 7 (business-within-a-business paradigm); tells us Building Blocks should be lines of business.
- At high level, **five Building Blocks** (five types of businesses); each has sub-categories.

### Overview of Building Blocks

- Building Blocks are lines of business that exist within organizations.
- Appear in every industry (corporations, not-for-profit, higher education, governments, even clubs).
- Same lines of business exist within departments inside enterprises.
- Building Blocks help avoid gaps (Principle 3); essentially checklist of all possible lines of business.
- All Building Blocks important; all should be creative, customer focused, entrepreneurial; all essential.

**Two Cautions:**
1. This framework is NOT a prescribed organization chart; Building Blocks simply provide language you can use to describe organization charts.
2. Some names may sound familiar; may have "Engineering" department today, but it may actually be combination of multiple Building Blocks. Don't confuse name of Building Block with name of group in current organization.

### Distinguishing Engineers and Service Providers

- Pick any industry, see two very different kinds of businesses:
  - **Engineers** design and produce products (assets), support those assets with design expertise.
  - **Service Providers** buy those assets, own and operate them, use them to deliver service.

| Engineer | Service Provider |
|---|---|
| Boeing | Airline |
| Ford | Hertz |
| Building contractor | Hotel |
| IT applications developers | IT infrastructure services |

- Engineers and Service Providers very different businesses (differing in competencies, business models, cultures, products and services); thus, separate Building Blocks.

### Building Block: Engineers

Definition: Engineers create organization's products; discipline or technology specialists, designers, gurus in those products.

#### Engineers Definition and Services

- Maintain locus of expertise in specific engineering discipline, technology, or professional specialty.
- Use expertise to design, build, install "solutions"; solution may be physical asset, software, or design of intellectual property.
- Also enhance, tune, repair, configure, support those solutions.
- Engineers sell anything requiring in-depth expertise in design of organization's products.
- Engineers don't own solutions they produce; sell solutions to others (peers within organization or external clients).

**Services of Engineers (all based on in-depth product-design expertise):**
- Solutions (entirely new, or enhancements)
- Repairs
- Configuration tuning
- Domain-specific incident management (second-level support, point of escalation for customer service)
- Documentation and training materials, and training
- Expert time, studies, presentations, sales support

**Examples Across Industries:**

| Industry | Engineers |
|---|---|
| IT | Applications developers, infrastructure systems engineers |
| HR | Compensation and benefits design, performance-management systems design |
| Finance | Tax law, investment financial analysis |
| Product manufacturers | Product designers, manufacturing engineers |
| Health care | Outcomes management, doctors |
| Education | Schools and professors, curriculum and instructional design |
| Government | Policy and program design, decisions on grants |

#### Applications versus Base Engineers

- **Applications Engineers:** Those who assemble components into complete products (top layer); produce purpose-specific products tailored to various kinds of customers' needs.
- **Base Engineers:** All lower layers; design components that go into various applications; components purpose-independent in that serve multiple applications.

**Examples:**

| Industry | Applications Engineers | Base Engineers |
|---|---|---|
| Automobiles | Car designers, truck designers | Engine, transmission, electrical system designers |
| Aerospace (Boeing) | Different kinds of airplanes | Engines, control systems, interiors |
| Higher education | Various schools (disciplines) | Curriculum and instructional design experts |
| IT | Data-object-specific software (financial, customer apps) | Computing platforms, database engines, middleware, telecommunications networks, end-user computing tools |

#### Engineers Competencies

| Dimension | Profile |
|---|---|
| Bottom of T | Domain of technology, science, or discipline |
| Key methods | Design and testing, project management |
| Technical skill | High |
| Project management | High |
| Service management (operations) | Low |
| Business of organization's customers | Low |
| Interpersonal skills | Low |
| People supervision | Medium |

Warning: If expected to produce anything other than solutions, depth in professional domain bound to suffer. Any time spend studying customers' businesses is time away from real specialty.

#### Engineers Biases

- Engineers love innovation, but quickly become bored when asked to do routine "keep it running" work.
- Laser focused on domain of expertise; count on other equally focused Engineers when other skills needed.
- Not experts in customers' businesses; cannot assess customers' needs in unbiased, business-driven manner.

| Conflict of Interests Dimension | Engineer Bias |
|---|---|
| Invention versus operational stability | Invention |
| Purpose-specific solutions versus components | Applications: Purpose-specific; Base: Components |
| Enterprisewide thinking versus focus of specialist | Specialist |
| Technical specialization versus unbiased diagnosis of clients' needs | Technical specialization |
| Service oriented versus audit | Service oriented |

### Building Block: Service Providers

Definition: Service Providers deliver ongoing services; may buy products from Engineers, then use those assets to deliver service; or service may be delivered primarily by people.

#### Service Providers Definition

- Distinguishing attribute: **ongoing nature of services**; essentially same routine service, day after day; think of services as water flowing from spigot.
- Service Providers keep things running reliably, safely, efficiently.
- Includes manufacturing, customer service, range of support services.

#### Asset-based Service Providers

- Services based on ownership of assets; customers essentially buying use of those assets.
- Business model: look for cases where customers can share use of asset; acquire those assets ("infrastructure"), use them to produce services.
- Assets include information as well as tangible properties.

**Examples Across Industries:**

| Industry | Asset-based Services |
|---|---|
| IT | Computer time, data storage, connectivity |
| HR | Benefits administration, employee data administration |
| Finance | Accounting services, treasury |
| Product manufacturers | Factories, warehouses, logistics |
| Health care | Hospital rooms, clinics, labs |
| Education | Classrooms, residence halls, library |
| Government | Roads, parks, ports and airports, air traffic control |

Asset-based Service Providers not technology specialists; rely on Engineers to build, document, upgrade, repair assets. Real expertise is in providing services.

#### People-based Service Providers

- Services produced by people rather than assets; buying "use" of people.

**Examples Across Industries:**

| Industry | People-based Services |
|---|---|
| IT | Service desk, field technicians, writers and trainers |
| HR | Counseling, recruiting, onboarding, job grading |
| Finance | Procurement, customer service |
| Product manufacturers | Customer service, field technicians |
| Health care | Admissions, nursing, non-medical services |
| Education | Registrar, admissions processing, student counseling |
| Government | Social services, elections, weather forecasts |

**Three Types of People-based Service Providers:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Product support | Services help customers get value from rest of organization's products and services | Customer service (help desk); training in use of organization's products |
| Internal support | Services leverage time and enhance abilities of others within organization | PMO (helps others manage projects); field technicians who follow instructions; technical writers |
| Business services | Services outside primary intent of organization | Administration, IT, Finance, HR departments from CEO's perspective; decentralized finance or administration functions |

#### Service Providers Competencies

| Dimension | Profile |
|---|---|
| Bottom of T | Specific services and how they're produced |
| Key methods | Service delivery and management |
| Technical skill | Medium |
| Project management | Low |
| Service management (operations) | High |
| Business of organization's customers | Low |
| Interpersonal skills | Asset-based: Low; People-based: High |
| People supervision | Asset-based: Medium; People-based: High |

#### Service Providers Biases

- Responsible for stability, responsiveness, reliability, security, low cost.
- Major innovations (inventions) inevitably disrupt smooth operations; biased to favor stability over innovation; change only when safe.

| Conflict of Interests Dimension | Service Provider Bias |
|---|---|
| Invention versus operational stability | Operational stability |
| Purpose-specific solutions versus components | Agnostic |
| Enterprisewide thinking versus focus of specialist | Specialist |
| Technical specialization versus unbiased diagnosis of clients' needs | Unbiased |
| Service oriented versus audit | Service oriented |

### Building Block: Coordinators

Definition: Some things require consensus among stakeholders; Coordinators drive those shared decisions.

#### Coordinators Definition

- Help stakeholders (within organization and beyond) come to agreement on shared decisions (policies, plans, standards).
- Establish processes for decision making; ensure right stakeholders involved; provide common information; facilitate collaboration on interdependencies.
- Not a Coordinator if, like all other stakeholders, you participate in these decisions; only Coordinator if job is to facilitate decision process.
- Also help people utilize resulting shared decisions; compile results and make them available; help others find, interpret, apply relevant policies, standards, plans.
- Coordinators NOT accountable for content; participating stakeholders are; Coordinators just accountable for effective consensus-based decision-making processes.
- Warning: Would be mistake to give Coordinators authority to force decision; since not accountable for others' results, doing so would violate Golden Rule.

#### Types of Coordinators: Business-Oriented

**Strategy Planning Coordinator**
- Expert in strategic planning methods, in business environment and how it creates threats and opportunities.
- Doesn't decide strategies; helps everybody decide own respective strategies, in coordinated fashion.

**Operational Planning Coordinator**
- Operating plan looks one or two years ahead; answers questions: "What do we plan to deliver? How will we fulfill demand?"
- Expert in business and budget planning methods (especially investment-based budgeting).

**Research Coordinator**
- Helps others do research, by sharing expertise in research methods and in how to develop research proposals.
- Helps executive decide which research projects to fund, as portfolio of investments aligned with strategies.
- Does NOT do any research; analogous to US National Science Foundation which distributes research grants.

**Organizational Effectiveness Coordinator**
- Focus on how organization does business (not what business produces): culture, structure, resource-governance processes, shared methods and tools, metrics and rewards.
- Distinct from Human Resources in that engineers "organizational ecosystem."
- Leads transformation projects (including restructuring), then helps everybody work within organizational design.

**Audit Response Coordinator**
- Helps everybody respond to auditors and provides point of contact; but content of audit response is responsibility of appropriate groups throughout organization.
- With knowledge of questions auditors ask, can offer voluntary "assessments" to help others prepare for audit.

**Regulatory Compliance Coordinator**
- Everybody accountable for complying with laws and regulations; helps them do so by providing expertise.
- Provides point of contact for regulators; coordinates any compliance examinations and remediation projects.

**Business Continuity Coordinator**
- Helps everybody develop own plans; coordinates interdependencies to optimize resilience.
- Coordinates tests of plan and (if triggered by actual incident) execution of plan.

**Security Coordinator**
- Expert in threats; helps everybody come to consensus on security policies; keeps people informed; leads investigations of and responses to security incidents.
- NOT audit function; does NOT check up on everybody's compliance with policies; NOT Service Provider offering ongoing security services.
- In IT, titled Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

#### Types of Coordinators: Technical

**Standards Coordinator**
- Standards are conscious constraints on design (not preferred brands and models); permit evolutionary change without loss of integration and interoperability.
- Does not decide standards; creates framework, then pulls together appropriate stakeholders to decide each "cell" within framework.
- Helps Engineers access and interpret agreed standards in course of designing solutions.

**Design Patterns Coordinator**
- Expert in "ripples" (how decisions about one domain affect others); facilitates consensus on design guidelines that affect all domains.
- Examples: city planning and zoning; distribution company pricing coordination; higher education cross-program initiatives.
- In IT: drives enterprise programs; maintains map of how existing systems interconnected and how data flows; in IT, combination of Standards and Design Patterns Coordinators called "enterprise architect."

#### Types of Coordinators: Function-Specific

**Information Policy Coordinator (IT)**
- Coordinates policies with regard to how information handled: retention policies, system-of-record determination, data ownership and access rights, privacy, acceptable use.

**Employment Policy Coordinator (HR)**
- Brings enterprise stakeholders to consensus on employment policies (compensation, talent management) to avoid inequities across enterprise.

#### Coordinators Competencies

| Dimension | Profile |
|---|---|
| Bottom of T | Topic being coordinated |
| Key methods | Consensus building, information structuring |
| Technical skill | Low (business) to Medium (technical) |
| Project management | Medium |
| Service management (operations) | Low |
| Business of organization's customers | Low |
| Interpersonal skills | High |
| People supervision | Low |

Note: Each Coordinator is expert in structure of content they are coordinating; know enough about content to understand trade-offs, but must not disempower others.

#### Coordinators Biases

| Conflict of Interests Dimension | Coordinator Bias |
|---|---|
| Invention versus operational stability | Invention |
| Purpose-specific solutions versus components | Agnostic |
| Enterprisewide thinking versus focus of specialist | Enterprisewide (or organizationwide) decisions |
| Technical specialization versus unbiased diagnosis of clients' needs | Unbiased |
| Service oriented versus audit | Service oriented |

### Building Block: Sales and Marketing

Definition: Client-facing part of organization; adds value in two ways: enhances organization's relationships with clients (default point of contact; facilitates effective communications); helps clients address challenges using organization's products and services.

#### Sales and Marketing Definition

- Sales staff help clients acquire just right products and services from organization's entire catalog.
- Word "sell" has two meanings: to provide product, or to help customers buy others' products. This Building Block does the latter; brokers sales.
- Sales NOT accountable for delivery of other groups' products and services.

#### Internal Service Providers Need Sales

- Building Block equally essential to internal service providers; have tough competition from decentralization and outsourcing.
- Goal for internal service providers: not to convince clients to spend more (expense to enterprise); rather, maximize organization's contributions to clients' success.
- Internal service providers may call this function "business relationship managers," "consultancy," or "Chief Digital Officer."

#### What Good Selling Is About

- Great salesmanship focuses on helping clients, not on helping organization "push" products and services. (Also called strategic selling, consultative selling, or partnership selling.)
- Great relationships built by recognizing what's unique about each client, understanding business challenges, connecting with right suppliers.
- Beyond relationship building, Sales helps clients discover creative, high-payoff uses of organization's products and services ("strategic alignment").
- Not passive order-taking; Sales proactively meets with key clients to discover ways organization can help.
- Internal Marketing helps clients understand organization's value; also helps internal service provider understand clients' needs through market research.

#### Decentralized Sales Functions

Warning: For many reasons, decentralization of Sales function not advisable:
- When decentralized, often devolves into full-service support function, rather than remain focused on just Sales Building Block.
- Decentralized Sales staff often treat centralized department as adversary.
- Makes hard to balance workloads.
- Generally difficulties introducing essential methods of Sales for lack of common boss.
- Often miss cross-business-unit opportunities.
- Decentralized Sales staff generally don't provide services to other Building Blocks within shared-services department.

#### Three Types of Sales

**Type 1: Account Sales**
- High-level account representatives responsible for entire client accounts.
- Proactively meet with selected client executives; produce stream of strategic projects.
- Very senior function; can attend clients' executive-level meetings and credibly discuss business strategies.
- Strategic impact immense; job grade should be as high as most senior leaders.

**Type 2: Retail Sales**
- Not dedicated to any specific accounts; territory is geographic.
- Default points of contact for clients' inquiries and concerns.
- May also include business analysts who convert high-level opportunities into detailed requirements.
- Distinction: Account Sales proactive, serve selected clients (top executives and key influencers); Retail Sales reactive, available to anyone on demand.

**Type 3: Function Sales**
- Experts in clients' professions or specific business processes (disciplines relevant to multiple accounts).
- Don't have territory; "second-tier" salesforce called in by Account and Retail Sales.
- Example: Medical device manufacturer brought trained hematologist when demonstrating device in hematology lab; brought trained immunologist when demonstrating in immunology lab.
- Example — IT: Experts in "digital enterprise" (application of technology to enterprise's relationship with customers); expertise can be applied to many business units and draws on many different technologies.

#### Marketing

- Focuses on clients as whole (either all, or segments with similar needs); distinguishes from Sales which works with clients individually.

**Marketing Communications (one-to-many):**
- Helps others in organization communicate with clients; coordinates organization's messages for consistency with strategies and brand.
- Includes branding and marketing communications strategies; publications; advertising and direct communications; promotions; customer events.

**Market Research (many-to-one):**
- Inbound communications channel; serves organization as window to entire client community.
- Answers questions about what clients think, want, need, will buy; ranges from customer-satisfaction surveys to market-demand forecasting models.

#### Sales and Marketing Competencies

| Dimension | Profile |
|---|---|
| Bottom of T | Clients, their business strategies, linkage to organization's products/services |
| Key methods (Sales) | Opportunity identification and requirements planning, relationship management, benefits estimation, contract brokerage |
| Key methods (Marketing) | Market communications, marketing strategy, market research |
| Technical skill | Low ("smart buyer's" knowledge of organization's entire product line) |
| Project management | Low |
| Service management (operations) | Low |
| Business of organization's customers | High |
| Interpersonal skills | High |
| People supervision | Low |

#### Sales and Marketing Biases

| Conflict of Interests Dimension | Sales and Marketing Bias |
|---|---|
| Invention versus operational stability | Agnostic |
| Purpose-specific solutions versus components | Agnostic |
| Enterprisewide thinking versus focus of specialist | Account: Specialist in clients; Others: Enterprisewide |
| Technical specialization versus unbiased diagnosis of clients' needs | Unbiased |
| Service oriented versus audit | Service oriented |

### Building Block: Audit

Definition: Audit Building Block includes more than traditional financial and compliance auditors; any function which inspects and judges others, and reports results to someone other than those being inspected.

#### Audit Definition

- Audit may even have some authority to block others (veto requests or decisions); only Building Block with such power.
- Audit distinguished from service-oriented Building Blocks: delivers findings to someone other than people being judged; people being judged are NOT their customers.
- Example: Epic failure of Arthur Anderson example of misunderstanding this. Financial crises in 2008 was, in part, caused by rating agencies paid by banks whose securities they judged.
- Distinction from assessments: Assessment voluntary (requested by manager); results reported back to those who were inspected. Audit imposed; results reported to someone other than those being judged.
- Audit's job: catch people not in compliance with rules, or stop people from making mistakes by vetoing decisions.

#### Need for Audit

- Audit often necessary, but should be considered control mechanism of last resort; far more expensive, less effective, than systemic controls.
- When rules of game induce people to comply (compliance in everyone's parochial self-interests), then control is systemic and Audit unnecessary.
- Example situation requiring Audit: when customers can't perceive differences in product quality (e.g., food contamination — consumers cannot know if item is contaminated, so government inspects food producers).
- Another situation: when employees have ability to gain personally by sacrificing well-being of organization (potential fraud).

#### Scope of Audit

- Mission of Audit strictly to uncover problems.
- Must NOT recommend corrective actions: Auditors' expertise in finding problems doesn't qualify them to design solutions.
- If Audit recommends solutions, would no longer be "arm's length"; might judge more harshly solution that complies but isn't what recommended.
- Auditors must NOT disempower managers by setting objectives or giving orders; order to comply with rules must come through chain of command.

#### Audit Competencies

| Dimension | Profile |
|---|---|
| Bottom of T | Topic being judged |
| Key methods | Audit process |
| Technical skill | High |
| Project management | Medium |
| Service management (operations) | Low |
| Business of organization's customers | Low |
| Interpersonal skills | Medium |
| People supervision | Low |

#### Audit Biases

| Conflict of Interests Dimension | Audit Bias |
|---|---|
| Invention versus operational stability | Operational stability |
| Purpose-specific solutions versus components | Agnostic |
| Enterprisewide decisions versus specialized expertise | Agnostic |
| Technical specialization versus unbiased diagnosis of clients' needs | Specialization in topic of audits |
| Service oriented versus audit | Audit |

Foundation: Audit not only distinct Building Block; to avoid conflicts of interests, must be kept entirely separate from all other service-oriented Building Blocks.

## Applying the Principles: Rainbow Analysis

Source: Paul Cezanne — "We live in a rainbow of chaos."

Context: Now ready to look at any organization chart and anticipate where structure getting in way of people's performance.

### Rainbow Analysis Overview

- First step: applying Building Blocks to organization chart.
- "Rainbow Analysis" guides through four questions to diagnose all problems designed into current organization chart.
- Reveals strengths and weaknesses (who's set up to fight with whom, who's set up to fail).
- Can also be used to examine proposed organization chart before implemented.
- Warning: Identifying structural problems not meant to accuse organization of failing. Good people can overcome almost any structural dysfunction. Rainbow Analysis only predicts potential problems, not actual failures.

### Rainbow Analysis Workshop

- Highly interactive workshop in which leadership team diagnoses current organization chart.
- Facilitated Rainbow Analysis workshop for dozens of leadership teams, in corporate, government, not-for-profit enterprises; invariably, eye opener.
- Even if don't decide to restructure, understand where problems coming from and why people struggling.

### Data Collection

1. Get organization chart (current structure or proposed new structure); print in poster size.
2. Get set of eight or more colored marker-pens.
3. Considering one Building Block at a time, revisit definition, interpret it in context of mission of organization.
4. Each leader takes turn putting colored stripe under box on chart if performs that function.
   - Red stripe: Sales; Blue: Applications Engineers; Purple: Base Engineers; etc.
5. Color-code organization chart, identifying which Building Blocks within each group.
6. Warning: If analyzing current organization, be honest and color-code based on what people actually do, regardless of what organization chart says.

Results: In most organizations, result is very colorful chart — why called "Rainbow Analysis."

### Question 1: Gaps

- **Gap:** Any color (line of business) that's missing, or done part-time by people whose primary focus is another function.

**Consequences of Gaps**

| Issue | Principle | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Unreliable processes | Principle 3 | Unreliable product/service delivery |
| Reduced specialization | Principle 2 | Lower productivity, slower delivery, lower quality, greater risk, less innovation, more stress, lower motivation |
| Overlaps (from gaps) | Principle 3 | Reduced specialization, redundant efforts, less innovation, confusion, product dis-integration, territorial friction, lack of entrepreneurship |

### Question 2: Rainbows

- **Rainbows:** Groups marked with more than one color, delivering multiple Building Blocks.

**Problems Created by Rainbows**

| Issue | Principle | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Reduced specialization | Principle 2 | Lower productivity, slower delivery, lower quality, greater risk, less innovation, more stress, lower motivation |
| Conflicts of interests | Principle 5 | Domain gaps, unpredictable and uncontrollable balance of conflicting objectives, stress |

- Example: Staff may be expected to keep operations stable (Service Providers) and also to innovate (Engineers).
- Example: May be expected to specialize in subset of products or services and also represent entire organization to clients (Sales) where supposed to be completely unbiased.
- Warning: Combination of Audit with any other Building Block is serious conflict of interests.

### Question 3: Scattered Campuses

- **Scattered Campus:** When color appears many different places on organization chart; in worst cases, all different sub-specialties within Building Block only come together at level of organization's top executive.

**Problems Created by Scattered Campuses**

| Issue | Principle | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Less professional exchange | Principle 6 | Higher costs, slower delivery times, product dis-integration |
| Less coordination | Principle 6 | Weaker mentoring and management controls, less load balancing, limited career paths, confusion, missed enterprise synergies |
| Domain overlaps | Principle 3 | Reduced specialization, redundant efforts, less innovation, confusion, product dis-integration, territorial friction, lack of entrepreneurship |
| Domain gaps | Principle 3 | Unreliable delivery, reduced specialization |
| Disempowerment | Principles 1, 7 | Lack of customer focus and entrepreneurship, less business planning, disempowerment |

### Question 4: Inappropriate Substructure

- **Inappropriate Substructure:** Basis for substructure is anything other than what Building Block supposed to be good at.
- Example: Engineers divided into groups based on clients' organization chart or business processes, rather than types of products they produce.

**Appropriate Bases for Substructure**

| Building Block | Appropriate Basis |
|---|---|
| Service Providers | Service |
| Engineers, Application | Purpose (in IT: data object) |
| Engineers, Base | Engineering discipline |
| Coordinators | What they coordinate (business, technical) |
| Sales, Account | Client territories (business units) |
| Sales, Retail | Geography, venue |
| Sales, Function | Client profession or business process |
| Marketing communications | Communications channel, service |
| Marketing research | Service (e.g., design, data collection, analysis) |

**Problems Created by Inappropriate Substructure**

| Issue | Principle | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Reduced specialization | Principle 2 | Lower productivity, slower delivery, lower quality, more risk, less innovation, more stress, poor morale |
| Domain overlaps | Principle 3 | Confusion, redundant efforts, territorial friction, product dis-integration, diminished entrepreneurship |
| Inappropriate biases | Principle 4 | Poor advice, optimizing wrong objectives (e.g., Sales divided by product line gives product-driven rather than business-driven recommendations) |
| Disempowerment | Principles 1, 7 | Lack of customer focus and entrepreneurship, less business planning, disempowerment |

### Interpreting the Rainbow Analysis

After going through four questions, raise next question: Is change needed? If so, need just few small "tweaks" or "clean sheet of paper" approach?

| Choice | Description |
|---|---|
| A. Do nothing | Current structure acceptable |
| B. Tweaks | Few small changes to existing structure |
| C. Clean sheet of paper | Completely new structure |

Warning: Many small tweaks more difficult than Clean Sheet approach; typically less effective, lacking whole-system perspective. Unless current structure very close to right, clean sheet of paper generally right way to go.

## Structures Designed to Fail: Case Studies

Source: Confucius — "Study the past if you would divine the future."

Context: Series of case studies describing approaches others have tried; use Rainbow Analysis to analyze faults. Warn about approaches that may be popular but have serious flaws.

### Strategy as Basis for Structure

#### Situation

- In 1962, Alfred D. Chandler proposed that "structure follows strategy"; theorized organization's structure could be fine-tuned to accomplish well-defined strategy.
- Satya Nadella, CEO Microsoft (June 17, 2015): "I'm certain that matching our structure to our strategy will best position us to build products and services our customers love."
- On surface, may seem logical; but serious flaws in this reasoning.

#### Rainbow Analysis

| Problem | Description |
|---|---|
| Gaps | "Strategy" rarely singular; not every strategy can be represented in structure; when new strategy occurs, may be no group dedicated to it |
| Rainbows | Approach creates "silo" organization, where each strategy-centric group includes all professional specialties; reduction in specialization hampers every strategy |
| Scattered campus | Many strategies draw on same specialties; if divided by strategy, specialties scattered; economies of scale and synergies lost |
| Inappropriate substructure | Staff encouraged to specialize in enterprise strategy, rather than in competencies supposed to contribute to that strategy |

#### Common Sense Argument

- Strategies can, and do, shift quickly and continually; to remain competitive, organizations must learn to be flexible.
- Warning: If structure were to follow strategy, organizations would have to restructure on frequent basis; prohibitively disruptive, expensive, disconcerting to staff.
- Warning: If don't continually restructure, organizations tuned to today's strategies destined to perform poorly at tomorrow's strategies.
- Warning: Organization structured around today's strategies will fail to discover tomorrow's strategies.

#### Alternative

- Well-designed organization chart, combined with effective teamwork, can handle any strategy.
- Mechanism: Strategy translates into specific initiatives; for each initiative, clear domains identify one and only group that "sells" that product or service; becomes "prime contractor"; then, teamwork processes take over.
- Result: Each strategic initiative draws from existing structure all needed competencies; organization can quickly recombine talents on new teams to address unlimited number of strategies.
- Foundation: Healthy organizations flexibly respond to diverse client strategies, while continually generating own strategies (reversing old adage that structure follows strategy).

### Outsource Non-Core Competencies

#### Situation

- Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema posited three "competencies": operational excellence, product/technology leadership, customer intimacy.
- Innumerable vendors and consultants suggest outsource everything not considered core competency.

#### Why Not Outsource

- Outsourcing less critical competencies doesn't magically strengthen remaining competency.
- Managing vendors certainly not easier than managing staff; vendor contracts often difficult to exercise.
- Even in less critical competencies, outsourcing can damage performance; reduces flexibility.
- Vendors can never be as well aligned with business strategies as insiders; vendors morally obliged to optimize best interests of their shareholders, not yours.
- Despite talk of "partnership," vendors never contribute to strategic thinking at same level as leaders within enterprise.
- In many cases, outsourcing doesn't save money; paying vendors profit to do what otherwise could do can turn out to be expensive.
- **Foundation: Ultimately, outsourcing entire function weakens it.**

#### Rainbow Analysis

| Problem | Description |
|---|---|
| Gaps | Weakness in any competency can jeopardize strategy; business conditions volatile, so strategies must be dynamic; organization designed to pursue only one competency ill-equipped when imperatives require other strengths |

Foundation: No organization can afford to focus exclusively on just one competency, settle for mediocrity in others.

#### Alternative

- For each Building Block, one competency dominant: Sales/Marketing dedicated to customer intimacy; Engineering to innovation; Service Providers to operational efficiency.
- When diverse groups combined into organization, organization as whole can include all Building Blocks (and all competencies).

#### When to Use Outsourcing

External vendors more cost-effective when:
- Multiple corporations can share vendor's assets (economies of scale cross corporate boundaries, e.g., telecommunication networks).
- Due to size, vendor can afford higher degree of specialization (particularly valuable in high-tech professions).
- Company requires more capital than available, willing to pay premium in operating expenses.
- Business volumes vary widely, or grow more quickly than organization can hire staff and acquire resources.

#### Extended Staffing

- **Extended staffing:** Vendors hired by internal staff to extend productive capabilities or improve value proposition; vendors part of staff of appropriate internal function, not independent service provider.
- Clients get product or service from internal staff, who may use vendors as part of delivery capability.
- Internal staff are "value-added resellers" of vendor services; make commitments to clients, manage vendors, retain accountability for results.
- Extended staffing promotes tight vendor integration; internal staff oversee vendors to ensure performance and compliance.
- Dynamic nature: when industry economics shift, staff can utilize vendors more or less; enterprise gets best balance between "make" and "buy" at any point in time.
- Foundation: Extended staffing gives enterprises benefits of outsourcing, without forsaking internal competencies.

### Managers as Client Liaisons

#### Situation

- Client executives complained Corporate IT didn't understand strategies, people, needs.
- CIO assigned set of business units to each senior leader; each leader had two roles: (1) manage technology-engineering or service group; (2) serve as liaison to set of client business units.
- Example: Phil headed applications developers for financial systems AND served as relationship manager for all IT to CFO.

#### Rainbow Analysis

| Problem | Description |
|---|---|
| Gaps | Phil had big group to manage; couldn't spend sufficient time with clients; Sales function remained gap; senior managers provided point of contact but didn't add much value to clients' strategic challenges |
| Rainbows | Phil, as expert in financial applications, couldn't honestly recommend anything other than extensions to general-ledger application; conflict of interests not lost on Jane; found difficult to trust objectivity of someone with vested interest in selling one particular solution |
| Inappropriate substructure | Other groups assigned to other clients set priorities for staff; Phil couldn't get help from Bev's group for Jane's Finance project; led to multiple overlapping financial applications cropping up throughout company; structure devolved into client-dedicated Engineering groups; productivity and quality suffered; enterprisewide synergies lost |

#### Alternative

- Mixture of clients and technologies was attempt to fill gap in structure: Account Sales function.
- Sales not part-time job for internal service provider's senior leaders, any more than engineering executives can serve as corporation's sales force in spare time.
- Sales should be separate group, within internal service providers as within companies.
- Small, dedicated team of Sales professionals will perform far better than same number of person-hours spent on client-liaison work distributed among managers of other functions.
- Foundation: Sales is profession in own right, warrants dedicated specialists.

### Decentralization

#### Situation

- Business unit leaders may prefer to have own support staff rather than work with enterprise shared-services department.

**Five things that drive desire for decentralization:**

| Driver | Description |
|---|---|
| Customer focus | Own staff will respect them and treat well; shared-services providers may treat as nuisance |
| Understanding business | Own staff "closer to business"; shared-services providers may force solutions that don't fit |
| Control of priorities | Can control priorities of own decentralized groups |
| Control of costs | Can control expenses more easily when group reports to them |
| Accountability | Mistaken belief that decentralization required to hold business-unit leaders fully accountable |

#### Rainbow Analysis

| Problem | Description |
|---|---|
| Gaps | Managers of decentralized groups still not effective at Account Sales function; strained relationships |
| Scattered campus | Each specialty scattered among business units; small groups that have to cover many domains can't specialize to same degree; lower performance, less innovation, higher costs |
| Inappropriate substructure | Every specialty substructured by client; each builds parochial solutions, undermining enterprise synergies |

#### Case Examples

- **Heavy-Equipment Manufacturing:** Each division built own manufacturing plant. Excess capacity in one plant while another pressured beyond capacity; transportation costs rose when divisions didn't use local plant; manufacturing techniques not shared across divisions.
- **Engineering Function:** Each division had own design engineering function; number of parts corporation had to make or buy skyrocketed; CEO-sponsored task-force found dozen different electric motors with roughly same specifications.
- **Insurance IT:** Multiple customer databases; company never knew when customer who bought from multiple business units was lost, because customer databases fragmented.

**Foundation:** Decentralization inevitably results in higher costs, slower delivery times, lower quality, less innovation, reduced career opportunities for staff, fragmented products and services.

**Warning:** Only thing worse than decentralization is shared-services organization that's not customer focused.

#### Federated Model

- "Federated" model: weak enterprise function for common services; all other services left to decentralized groups.
- Warning: Nice name doesn't solve any problems caused by decentralization.
- Warning: Adopting federated model actually makes things worse; institutionalizes decentralization.

#### Dotted Lines from Decentralized Groups

- Some companies attempt to ameliorate problems with "dotted line" drawn from decentralized groups up to leader of enterprise-level shared-services provider.
- Warning: From cynical perspective, might be attempt to make corporate executives accountable for behavior of people they cannot control; violates Golden Rule (accountability without real authority).
- Warning: Real (decentralized) managers generally win political battles; decentralized staff caught in middle.
- Foundation: Pragmatically, dotted line gives shared-services executives no real authority.

#### Roles of Shared Services Amidst Decentralization

If have to tolerate decentralized (federated) environment, enterprise shared-services organizations can still fulfill five roles:

1. Full-service provider to clients in corporate headquarters.
2. Sole (monopoly) provider of short list of products and services where synergies and economies of scale widely accepted; must be determined through consensus of business-unit leaders.
3. "Outsourcing" supplier whenever decentralized groups wish to buy from it; decision completely at discretion of business unit; must earn business through excellent performance, value, relationships.
4. Sole provider of coordination services where decisions must be made that affect entire enterprise; Coordinators have no formal power; facilitates consensus on standards, policies, plans.
5. Spokesperson for profession; never speak for others or make commitments for others; can further profession by encouraging collaboration and representing profession's interests.

Results: By accepting accountability only for these five roles, shared-services organization can contribute to enterprisewide objectives without threatening business unit autonomy. "Soft" approach actually strong approach.

#### Alternative: Shared Services

- "Shared services" refers to internal service provider that serves multiple clients; instead of each business unit owning own little group, clients buy products and services from central supplier.

**Benefits of Shared Services:**

| Benefit | Description |
|---|---|
| Reduced costs | When redundancies eliminated; eliminate parallel training, product R&D, policy formulation, support functions |
| Customization maintained | Team of specialists can tailor solutions to unique customers' needs at lower cost and higher quality than small generalist groups |
| Consortia opportunities | Multiple clients share single solution; even if unique solutions needed, can reuse some components and knowledge |
| Economies of scale | Better balancing workloads; one business unit's peak load may occur when other business units slow; total peak demand generally less than sum of each business unit's peak |
| Consolidated buying power | Vendor licenses may be shared at lower cost; bigger organization has more bargaining power |
| Size improvements | Supports broader, more diverse product line; can support products globally, 24 by 7; can afford higher-caliber management |
| Specialization | Substructuring staff in appropriate way increases specialization |
| Enterprise synergies | As business units find themselves using same services, may collaborate more across boundaries |

**Foundation:** Well-designed and well-managed shared-services organization not only performs better, but can improve performance throughout enterprise.

#### Prerequisites for Shared Services

Before business units give up decentralized groups, shared-services organization has to address reasons clients like decentralization:

| Driver for Decentralization | Solution in Shared Services |
|---|---|
| Customer focus | Matter of culture (habits and practices); teach staff specific behaviors that embody customer focus; first, structure has to clarify whom customers are |
| Understanding clients' businesses | Job of Account Sales function; dedicate Account Sales professional, not Engineers, to each client business unit |
| Control over priorities | Give clients control of spending power rather than dedicated staff |
| Control of costs | Costs should never be allocated to business units on any basis other than utilization; holding business-unit executives accountable for costs can't control is futile |
| Accountability | Business unit leaders held accountable for use of shared services, just as accountable for purchases from vendors; shared-services must be able to portray costs by business unit, based on consumption |

Foundation: If meets these requirements, shared-services organization doesn't threaten business unit autonomy any more than buying from external vendors.

## Special Situations

Context: Common challenges that, on surface, might seem to force deviation from ideal structure; but ways to approach challenges without compromising Principles.

Special situations discussed: Self-managed groups, Shared people, Remote locations, Project management office, Compliance and governance.

### Self-managed Groups

- Definition: Line of business is small, perhaps just few people, and no one person significantly more senior than others.
- Could put staff under manager of related line of business; but may risk extending manager too far, or creating undesirable "rainbow."
- Alternative: Leave line of business as box on organization chart, but with no manager; termed "self-managed group."

**Advantages of Self-managed Groups:**
- Maintains focus on that line of business, rather than burying within another line of business.
- Provides growth path for function that may someday warrant manager.
- Useful when members need to be placed at higher level in structure to get political visibility needed to be effective (e.g., few senior Account Sales staff may all report directly to organization's executive).
- Helpful when members need to be placed at higher level to get job-grade (compensation) needed.

**Choices for Sharing Supervisory Duties:**
- Boss (level up) does it.
- "Lead" (perhaps on rotating basis) does it.
- Any individual can do it independently.
- Group collaborates on it (e.g., through consensus).

Note: Some portion of everyone's performance appraisal should be based on performance of whole group (shared destiny).

Warning: Contrary to first impressions, self-managed groups do NOT save headcount; supervisory duties must still be fulfilled; total supervisory workload may actually increase.

**Disadvantages of Self-managed Groups:**
- May not be as coherent in business strategies and directions.
- May be slower to acquire new methods and tools.
- Require more attention from manager above them.
- While supposed to behave as single direct report, inevitably reduce feasible span of manager at next level up.

Foundation: Self-managed groups not goal in themselves; simply way of treating situations that warrant structural separation but not manager; approach should be used with caution.

### Shared People: Temporary Duty

- Definition: Sometimes appropriate for one manager to loan individual to another, part time or full time, temporarily or indefinitely. (Term borrowed from military: "temporary duty.")

**When Temporary Duty Needed:**
- Certain individuals have skills beyond domain of their group ("rainbow" people); better to put person on loan to other group than to expand group's domain to encompass skills.
- Move portions of headcount from one group to another as workloads shift ("load balancing").

**Mechanics:**
- Borrowing person is not a contract between two groups for delivery of service; simply loan of person.
- All accountability for work remains with receiving group; receiving managers may even pay individual's salary for that period.
- If situation permanent, equivalent to individual holding two part-time jobs, reporting to two different managers.
- Not "dual reporting" (two managers supervise person doing single job); person works in two distinct domains, hence has two distinct part-time jobs.
- Two managers must be very clear about allocation of person's time; must agree on when that time available to each.
- Individual should have "home" group, reporting to one manager who is administratively accountable.
- Administrative manager takes lead responsibility for writing individual's performance appraisal; other manager should contribute in proportion to amount of time spent.

### Remote Locations

Definition: In geographically dispersed organizations, some remote locations may have very few staff; but organization still has to deliver all products and services to clients in that location.

**Four ways to address remote locations:**

#### Option 1: Rainbow Groups

- Create "rainbow" group that combines all Building Blocks; similar to decentralization.
- Advantages: simplicity; minimal teamwork across geographic distances required.
- Warning: Has all disadvantages of silo; reduces specialization; sends signal acceptable to violate Principles; sets bad precedent.
- Foundation: Generally, location-specific "rainbow" groups should be avoided; with internet and modern collaborative tools, rare in most businesses.

#### Option 2: Site Coordinators

- In larger remote groups, each specialist reports to appropriate manager at central location.
- Advantages: single boss, consistency in technical directions, remote staff participation in professional directions.
- One of remote people (typically most senior) appointed "site coordinator" to deal with location-specific issues (personnel policies, dress codes, hours of operation).
- Site coordinators can serve as agent for remote staff's real managers; may help with generic (not domain-specific) supervisory duties.
- Site coordinators should have input to remote staff's performance appraisals.
- Site-coordinator duties distinct from client-liaison function (Retail Sales for that location), although Retail Sales person may happen to be designated site coordinator.
- Site-coordinator duties over-and-above person's normal functional responsibilities.

#### Option 3: Technician Services

- In small remote groups where staff work in multiple domains, remote group deemed "Technician Services" business (People-based Service Provider).
- Technicians sell time to others within organization, acting as their agents ("eyes and hands in field"); all technical direction comes from subject-matter experts who hire them.
- Technicians don't sell anything directly to clients; just agents of another group; accountability flows through appropriate function.
- Warning: Doesn't work for Account Sales or Coordinators; these functions should be delivered centrally, even to remote locations.

#### Option 4: Temporary Duty

- If predominant function in location and all staff there involved in that to some degree, manager and staff may report to that function.
- To fulfill other functions in location, any of staff (manager included) can be loaned to other groups as temporary duty.

### Project Management Office

Definition: Excellence in project management essential to reliable project delivery; on large, complex projects, particularly critical.

Warning: Traditionally, project leader accountable for managing every aspect of project; but for large projects, few people have sufficient project-management skills. Some leaders create small group of "super project managers" for difficult projects — this creates problems.

#### Case Study: PMO that Manages Projects

- Fred (applications engineers) weak in project-management skills; CIO asked Kathy to form PMO.
- Kathy accountable for big or complex projects; Fred just "body shop" supplying people.
- Warning: Kathy's project managers not applications engineering experts; nonetheless, controlled who on project team, their assignments, schedules, key design decisions; with non-technical people calling shots, quality suffered.
- Warning: Kathy not accountable for long-term applications support; cut corners to get projects out on time.
- Warning: Fred disempowered; couldn't control key design decisions; but still accountable for future support, maintenance, operational efficiency, integrations.
- Warning: Fred's staff, being just body shop on all interesting projects, demoralized; had little incentive to improve project-management skills (root cause of problem).
- Result: As expected, Kathy and Fred at odds — structure set them up to fight.

#### Project Management as Service

- Project-management experts important; PMO in itself not problem; in fact, great way to bring discipline and proficiency to project delivery.
- Problems come from PMO that's accountable for projects, occasionally taking over delivery of other groups' products.
- Foundation: Effective PMO is People-based Service Provider, accountable for delivering project planning and facilitation services; helps everyone succeed at respective projects, without assuming project leadership or accountability for results.

### Compliance and Governance

- "Compliance" processes ensure organizations follow rules, including own policies and standards, contractual obligations, myriad laws and regulations.
- "Governance" = all processes that coordinate and control organization's resources and actions.
- Too often, executives assume "governance" means person or committee with authority to control others.

#### Case Study: Chief Compliance Officer

- Allison appointed Chief Compliance Officer in IT department of huge financial services company.
- Warning: Three factors working against this approach:
  1. Others not accountable for compliance; won't put much effort into something not in own performance objectives.
  2. Others accountable for business results; not going to compromise missions to help Allison with objectives.
  3. Others don't need to worry about compliance (Allison's problem); if mess up and bad things happen, she'll take blame — essentially given title "Chief Scapegoat."
- Foundation: All factors encourage Allison's peers to find ways around controls to get jobs done.

#### Who Decides Trade-offs

- Realists know there are trade-offs between compliance costs and business impact.
- Trade-offs had to be made with full understanding of both risks and business impacts.
- Far more effective if decisions collaborative: either compliance officer could study business and make decisions, or teach others risks and let those who know business decide.
- Warning: If compliance officer makes decisions, battle brewing (fighting to minimize risks, while managers fight to maintain operations).

#### Everyone Must Be Accountable

- Only one way to make managers want to collaborate: hold all accountable for own compliance.
- Golden Rule: if compliance officer makes decisions, has to be held accountable not just for compliance but for everybody's business results; otherwise, what's to stop from deciding in favor of too much compliance, sacrificing business results?
- Foundation: Right approach: hold everybody accountable for own behaviors, including own compliance. Overall, success rate of compliance initiatives higher, not lower, when authority and accountability in right place.

#### Compliance as Service

- When everybody accountable for own compliance, organization doesn't need someone who forces others to comply; but still needs compliance officer.
- **Job of Compliance Officer:** Help others succeed with compliance accountabilities; service based on expertise in how regulations affect organization and its clients.
- Compliance is Coordinator function; helps others succeed at accountabilities, including helping agree on shared decisions and processes.
- Roles:
  - Point of contact for regulators; coordinate organization's response.
  - Help individual managers put together own policies and plans.
  - Bring stakeholders to consensus on shared policies and plans.
  - Help others agree on shared initiatives that improve compliance.
  - As Coordinator, manage tests of plans, while everybody remains accountable for own groups' responses.
  - Teach others regulatory requirements, risks of non-compliance, kinds of changes required to mitigate risks.

#### Oversight

- May be need for oversight; but shouldn't be mixed with service role.
- Warning: Real auditors outside (regulators, hackers for security, Mother Nature for business continuity); if seen as auditor, doors close as approach.
- Remaining service oriented, can sell "compliance assessment studies" that help managers get ready for real external audit; must maintain good relationships to implement meaningful change.

#### Scapegoat Trap

- Many functions can fall into scapegoat trap by claiming authority over, hence accepting accountability for, others' behaviors.
- Examples of scapegoat trap:
  - "Security" group thinks accountable for security, rather than helping everyone operate in secure manner.
  - "Business continuity" group unilaterally designs plan.
  - "Quality assurance" or "testing" group tries to take accountability for quality through inspection and control.
- Foundation: Total Quality Management principle — quality, in all forms, is attribute of product or service, not separate deliverable. Experiences in every industry prove: responsibility for compliance, safety, security, every other aspect of quality should never be separated from responsibility for doing work.
- Foundation: In every case, better results achieved when everybody held accountable for own behaviors; Coordinators help others with accountabilities; if oversight (Audit) needed, must be kept arm's-length from service-oriented Coordinators.

## Workflows: Teamwork Processes

Source: James A. Garfield — "Commerce links all mankind in one common brotherhood of mutual dependence and interests."

- Focused so far on design of organization chart; now time to turn attention to processes of cross-boundary teamwork.
- Teamwork not luxury; essential aspect of organizational design; can't specialize if can't team (Principle 2).
- Henry Mintzberg: "Structure of organization can be defined simply as sum total of ways in which labor divided into distinct tasks and... [how] coordination achieved among these tasks."

### Importance of Teamwork

- Teamwork often gating factor in organizational design; organizations not very good at it deliberately create "silo" groups which can function relatively independently.
- Warning: In doing so, scatter profession among all groups that need it, hence reduce specialization; consciously give up some organizational performance to avoid investing in more effective teamwork processes.
- Warning: Even if self-sufficient silos not created deliberately, occur automatically if neglect teamwork processes; without effective teamwork, groups inevitably evolve into silos of self-sufficient generalists.
- Foundation: Better organization is at cross-boundary teamwork, more can afford to specialize and optimize performance; if want to build high-performance structure, must be prepared to invest in mechanisms of teamwork.
- By investing in teamwork, don't mean team-building; lot more to it than liking and trusting one another; effective cross-boundary teamwork depends on explicit mechanisms for forming and coordinating teams.

### What Not to Do to Improve Teamwork

#### Case Study: Randy's Teamwork Challenges

- Randy inherited seasoned executives technically qualified, nice people — but ran groups as independent silos with minimal collaboration.
- Problems: many skills replicated across groups; people spread thinly as tried to do too many things.
- Applications developers ran own development servers without security, continuity planning, even back-ups.
- Infrastructure group had own applications developers for billing system.
- Each department had own support functions (budgeting, purchasing).
- Two infrastructure control centers; three different help desks.
- Each department had own client liaisons (Sales); clients got different, sometimes conflicting, answers from different "single points of contact."

#### Failed Approach 1: Team-building

- Randy hired consultant for one-day seminar on teamwork; leaders agreed with everything said; but back on job, nothing changed.
- Randy brought consultant back for three-day resort team-building; got to know one another lot better, everyone had great time; but back on job, nothing changed.

#### Failed Approach 2: Job Rotations

- Randy tried job swapping; head of infrastructure assigned to applications; head of applications went to client support; etc.
- Leaders developed lot of empathy for one another; but still nothing changed.
- Former head of infrastructure, now leading applications group, requested money to upgrade development servers; new head of infrastructure fiercely defended need for own billing application developers.
- Scheme lasted about three months, at which time Randy put everyone back; cynics among staff got good laugh.

#### Failed Approach 3: Process Engineering

- Randy hired consultants to train staff and implement ITIL "best practices"; DevOps; Lean-Six Sigma process engineering.
- Processes defined everybody's tasks; but no one accountable for results.
- Warning: Randy designated "process owners" to oversee processes end-to-end; process owners violated Golden Rule by trying to tell others how to do jobs.
- Warning: Organization became more bureaucratic, less flexible, less accountable.

#### Failed Approach 4: Forced Consolidation

- Randy mandated reorganization; consolidated three help desks, moved development server into computer center, set up single Client Liaison group reporting directly to him.
- Result: Utter chaos for while; after few months, things settled down.
- Unified help desk did fine job of transferring calls to three "level-two" help desks.
- Development servers moved into computer center, but applications developers insisted on managing themselves; reliability and security issues remained.

## Benefits and Cultural Transformation

Source: Max De Pree — "First responsibility of leader is to define reality. Last is to say thank you. In between two, leader must become servant."

Restructuring organization not easy; easy to simply draw boxes and assign names; but doing so does little to improve organization's effectiveness. Building high-performance organization takes meticulous planning; transformational, participative process adds to leaders' workloads; process stressful (people worry about careers, status, power).

### Efficiencies

**Sources of Efficiencies:**
- Overlaps eliminated: Time saved by eliminating redundant efforts, territorial disputes, time managers spend sorting out who does what.
- Role clarity permits greater span: With clear domains, groups self-directed to far greater extent; permits flatter organization, reduces supervisory workloads.
- Professional collaboration encouraged: Bringing together related specialties induces more professional exchange; precludes redundant research, accelerates organizational learning, improves productivity, enables more reusable components.

Warning: Be cautious about using efficiency gains to justify restructuring initiative; may lead to expectations of reduced budgets and headcount.

In practice, efficiencies often reinvested in doing more with same budget:
- Organizations catch up on critical sustainment tasks (training, innovation, planning, relationship building).
- Improve quality of services and reduce risks.
- Catch up on deferred maintenance.
- More responsive to customers, addressing backlogs and pent-up demand.
- Find new opportunities to deliver more value by filling gaps.

Warning: Promising cost savings from restructuring associates new organization with job losses; can set staff against change. Efficiencies develop gradually over time, not instantly upon announcement of new organization chart.

### Effectiveness

- Effectiveness more important than efficiency, even in companies concerned about costs.
- Efficiencies produce marginal cost savings, whereas improving effectiveness enhances organization's contribution to business (highly-leveraged benefit).
- Example: Reducing headcount by one might save $100,000 per year; but if greater effectiveness means one more strategic project each year, benefits could be counted in millions.

**Reasons Well-Designed Structure Improves Effectiveness:**

| Reason | Description |
|---|---|
| Gaps eliminated | Assigning accountability for missing lines of business can deliver value not available from old organization; creating new Sales function improves relationships and strategic alignment |
| Specialization increases | Scattered campuses consolidated; greater focus and specialization produces improved productivity, faster and more reliable delivery, higher quality, lower risk, more innovation, less stress |
| Accountabilities for results clear | Groups defined as lines of business; results-orientation delivers results; easier to know where to go; facilitates performance management |
| Teamwork enhanced | Instead of each group attempting to be self-sufficient, best talent from wide range of relevant specialties contributes to each project; produces far better results than generalists working alone |
| Organization scalable | Makes easier for organization to grow, take on new technologies and missions, integrate acquisitions; possible to design structure that lasts lifetime |
| Executive bottleneck eliminated | Empowered staff don't need to be micro-managed; executives can rise above day-to-day and focus on more strategic challenges |

### Cultural Transformation

In addition to improved efficiency and effectiveness, healthy structure has powerful impacts on organization's culture.

**Empowerment**
- When jobs defined by what people "sell" (results), accountabilities well defined; staff can be empowered to produce results as they see fit.
- Improves reliable delivery; encourages creativity and innovation; encourages quality (staff fully responsible for own results; incentive to do things right first time — core principle of Total Quality Management).

**Customer Focus**
- Running businesses within business, staff recognize funded to serve customers.
- Focus on delivering products and services to customers, rather than on bureaucratic territories, procedures, tasks.
- Build effective working relationships with customers; understand what customers want by listening, responding to customers' priorities.

**Entrepreneurship**
- Since groups defined as lines of business, everybody is entrepreneur.
- Entrepreneurs know have to be reliable to stay in business; learn not to make commitments can't keep.
- Entrepreneurs continually seek new opportunities to add value; proactively discover ways to contribute to customers' success.
- Entrepreneurs optimize costs and methods; continually seek ways to deliver more value at lower cost.
- Entrepreneurs plan future of businesses; develop strategies, invest in capabilities, evolve product lines.
